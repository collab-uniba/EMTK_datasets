Sorry I narrowed down the issue to Chrome's over-zealous caching. I was able to reproduce the problem on two separate computers in a simple project where I had upgraded from Wicket 1.4.0 to 1.4.15.

Clearing the browser cache resolved the issue.  Sorry about the bogus bug report.;negative

If this is deemed to be a valid bug you can use my upcoming patch which simply doesn't pass the calls  to getLoginTimeout and setLoginTimeout through to the BasicDataSource.  I guess it could be a  good thing to let the BasicDataSource throw the UnsupportedOperationException notifying the  programmer that their call to the method really isn't doing anything.    OTOH they probably  care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way.   If they really want to know why their call to setLoginTimeout isn't working they can check the  included javadoc.  So if you decide it's a bug then there's a patch coming...;neutral

bq. I'm attaching a patch which adds a second query() method to SolrServer which takes the request method as the second argument.  Shouldn't that be specific to an HTTP server?;neutral
Mike: patch reads nice and clean to me (didn't try applying though)  two nits:   1) it would be good to have a test of the case where a boolean with the default boost is specified in one bq and a seperate blank bq is specified to force the first BQ to be treated as a single query  2) let's assign  params.getParams(DMP.BQ) to a temp variable so we don't have to call it twice in three lines.;neutral
Hi Guillaume  I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status is quite useful.  But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.  I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode otherwise it's better not  to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point that we've just implemeted.  Do you agree with this??  Andrea ;neutral

Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length];positive

Your work is very good and pass all tests but it is not like just a simple bug fix and there is a divergence from FVH java. This makes life hard while making new versions' ports.

Jason  did you get a chanse to try this out? It seems to work fine for me and I plan to pop it in the trunk in a few days. I think I'll have to add a warning of some kind in runtime though as it could slow down the index a bit if the reader is way fragmented.;neutral

I did nothing special. My understanding was that simply trying to test under JDeveloper caused the problem. Your report says removing xmlparserv2 causes JDeveloper not to start.  Is there something else I need to do to cause the problem?  FYI - I created a Maven project with the code above as the only application. I then imported the application which was a bit frustrating as it didn't seem to accomplish much. I then had to manually add the log4j 2 jars into the classpath along with target/classes and had to make a couple of other changes so that it knew how things were laid out in the project. I then ran the application from JDeveloper and it ran fine.;neutral

"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call similar to getRecordIfStored it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well not swallowed exactly but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  ";positive

Oleg  I agree it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike;neutral

Hi Lars sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO the fix makes it easier to understand as well.

So there is another thing here by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from CMS space thus radically increasing the GC complexity of the cache.

Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. ;neutral

Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.      ;negative

Thanks Bryan for converting these tests.  In using the DERBY-2152 conversion tool can you double check that it does not omit  the fail assert method after a method call in a try-catch block when the statement is expected to fail.  e.g. instead of   try {   s.execute(command);positive
I haven't spent enough time thinking about this but I think it is more than just fixing the error message string. It seems that the comparable method in DTD should return int rather than boolean and the return int value will decide if we should throw what we are throwing today (ie something like ERROR 42818: Comparisons between 'VARCHAR' and 'CHAR' are not supported. ) or throw a new message because collations don't match. This is just my initial thought haven't spend enough time to think about a solution ;neutral
These look just fine -- thanks for your hard work on all these fixes Dag! If they are technically correct I say +1 to commit.;positive

Unfortunately I have no Sql Server to test against at the moment. But I wonder does this work when using a table name like 'SomeTable' (note the upper case). If you could verify for me that such mixed case names work with your patch when not in delimited mode then I'll apply it ASAP.  Tom;negative
1) Yea we'll need Java 6 for the future stuff. Wasn't sure what the project's posture on that is. 2) Not a problem... documentation is key.  However I don't think this patch should be accepted as-is :-) There is a LOT of duplicate code in my patch. I did this because I didn't want to mess with the QueryRunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid. However there are a number of methods in the AsyncQueryRunner are improved from the QueryRunner (see DBUTILS-79).  I propose that we create a base or abstract class which both QueryRunner and AsyncQueryRunner extend. Thoughts? ;neutral

Released in ClickIDE 2.2.0.0.;neutral
"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback.  I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). ";positive

bq. guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names?  We probably don't need to do anything. I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code.  I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades do you had something in mind?  Note: I have a long flight ahead of me so I plan to update my last patch with both those changes as I still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class even if we don't support both layout.;neutral
Did you get a chance to try a patched build?;neutral
Truth is that the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. ;neutral

Hmm I can't apply 0002-V2 on top of either my 0001 + trunk from feb 5 or current trunk + rebased 0001.

Hi Willem yes you're right.. I did not realized that I had a explicit dependency on the wrong version... You can close this ticket. ;neutral

I'll look into the namespace handler. Thanks.  Yes I should have added the different event handling support to the TODO above. I need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more. Using just the endpoint api I couldn't create routes on the fly hence the polling consumer approach.  I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems. Everything repeats itself :)  ;positive
JB do you expect problems when we upgrade Camel 2.10.0 to Spring 3.1.0 (and deploy it into Karaf 2.2.x)? Because Camel leverage on the Karaf Spring feature it will use Spring 3.0.x when running inside Karaf 3.0x and Spring 3.1.x when running in Karaf 3.0.x.   IMO when we can upgrade to Spring 3.1.0 without any modification it should not a problem...;neutral

Hmm - it seems that the patch cannot be applied on a few files - e.g. the CxfEndpoint.java patch.

Somehow it seems that this problem is more on the rubygems side. I didn't have time to investigate it any further but looks like rubygems is using @gems internally sometimes as a hash and sometimes as an array.

If I put my hands in the code to fix stuff myself I will probably introduce something that is illogical for you (e.g.;neutral
5% seems pretty low.;neutral
We can use a BlockingQueue to make the patch simpler;neutral
I think we should distinguish between the two;neutral
More tomorrow.;neutral
Same for the settings.xml with cleartext password (this caused my initial 401 problem no way in hell im leaving such a thing around on my computer).;neutral
Maybe ant could read the password like it does for GPG and handle this for us?;neutral
The patch also removes FreqProxMergeState because we don't have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course.;neutral
The patch also removes FreqProxMergeState because we don't have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course.;neutral
It uses a parallel benchmark that roughly models what our real-life benchmark is like.;neutral
Too bad we don't have the power to do that... -)  Here's what I think should be happening:  Internally absolutely everything should be handled UTF-8 for consistency's sake.;neutral
should the following be true?;neutral
Hi  Could u please change the moderator of this list to Davanum Srinivas : dims@apache.org  Chamikara;neutral
{quote} Dear Azuryy Yu  This message acknowledges receipt of your ICLA which has been filed in the Apache Software Foundation records.;neutral
Marvin I've clogged these lists too often today so I'll just say this to you. ;neutral
Forgot to close;neutral
sigh.;neutral
Ummm did you forget to annex the patch Toby?;neutral
You cannot load classes from a bundle after the framework shuts down.;neutral
Of course this means that I can't compile/build the code using AxisRC3.;neutral
Clearly one Visitor interface just can't satisfy everyone.;neutral
Like skip.jar.loading= true once ---> Proposed behaviour.;neutral
Is not really needed I guess.;neutral
"Also I find the name ""stillGoodJournals"" confusing because when a journal was found to be bad in the ""// do the sync"" block it isn't removed from the ""stillGoodJournals"" list.";neutral
With balancer initialy at true: {code} hbase@node3:~/hbase-0.94.3$ bin/graceful_stop.sh --restart --reload --debug node6 Disabling balancer!;neutral
@filipe I forgot the case where includes are in include/js (or mozjs).;neutral
The latest  patch for SimpleURIResolver and resolver framework.;neutral
Matt what's the cut-off date for providing a patch?;neutral
br Matt;neutral
For testing purposes of course...  ;neutral
True enough....;neutral
That is not true.;neutral
Default is true.;neutral
Yes that's true.;neutral
duplication of such a small amount of trivial code is far less evil than yet another dependency.;neutral
The first step is of course selling us through our site.;neutral
But in any case please keep things simple and stupid :)  ;neutral
Matt;neutral
"Are there other parts of your app that interact with or manipulate the ""course"" bean or its ""labKits"" collection?";neutral
The name for all of them was thus pretty obvious except for engine.evaluate(...) and #evaluate(...).;neutral
Of course that would be a separate bug...;neutral
OK works for me.;neutral
I must admit I'm a little confused by this one.;neutral
Otherwise the HTable and the HConnection will get very confused.;neutral
Of course if you're writing your own serializer it's your responsiblity to deal  with this appropriately.;neutral
Pretty impressive.;neutral
I think the ability to hotswap a valve or even an entire pipeline real-time is pretty damn kewl!  ;neutral
Well your static analysis seems pretty persuasive to me.;neutral
What mocking framework should be used for the webui?;neutral
At least it was intuitive for me and I am pretty new to all this.;neutral
I'm assuming it's bytes since the variables are named 'buf' as opposed to the 'str' names used in the protocol APIs but want to double-check.;neutral
I deleted the original attached files because they contain company informations that I'm not allowed to disclose.;neutral
I'll have to bisect the revision since when it is broken and this could take some time.;neutral
Yep my bad too - I didn't look and was just guessing at what the problem was.;neutral
"- the computedHashCode() didn't use the a single ""qualifier"" now it does.";neutral
The memory stream transformation core-dump was the same case (rb_tree - erase).;neutral
Wicket 6 now features an experimental module that integrates the Atmosphere framework (wicket-atmosphere).;neutral
Then the algorithm gets lost as it did not expect this discontinuity.;neutral
#2 wontbe so bad... filters are pretty deep and will be just as efficient as hacking scan query Matcher I think.;neutral
Maybe you want to do shuffle in this way: Firstly copying remote map outputs and store the shuffled segments into memory as usual.;neutral
The outer read can continue for a much longer period of time.;neutral
Note that I wouldn't be totally opposed on adding additional support for the dot notation on inserts (provided all fields are indeed given) for symmetry/convenience.;neutral
"If I get to this first I will make the ""frameworks"" fix as well.";neutral
Show time since declared as dead on the deadnode web UI.;neutral
just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.;neutral
html/ext/HtmlInputHiddenTag.java is pretty simple all of the functionality is in its base class. ;neutral
Tag is documented and demo'd but does need a Facelets tag.;neutral
I would rather state that most Java libraries *do* care about Maven.;neutral
this is IMO a regression since i am pretty sure it used to throw an InvalidItemStateException in the past.;neutral
I'll take a look at where the framework should call it.;neutral
"Similarly one can use the overview of FD:OCA below and the introductory section of its respective volume and only ** refer to the details of the FD:OCA constructs as needed during implementation.""";neutral
It's unfortunate that there's a lot of code duplication but it might be best that way.;neutral
"However the NPE in the framework is still an issue even if it happens when there is a ""user error"".";neutral
Downgrading this as it is probably user error (rather than an explicit bug in the framework).;neutral
Nothing stops a slightly evil user to use a NoLock to wreak havoc in the index.;neutral
I pretty much have this working.;neutral
It can't have been this way always?;neutral
Patrick  I can't manage to reproduce this error.;neutral
[~jbellis] The weird thing is that although *newSSTables.size() != newSSTablesSize* the assertion doesn't actually cause an error so no stack trace but swapping the assertion (as shown below) yields the stack trace below.;neutral
I would have checked it in directly but there were some aspects  that I didn't care for but couldn't seem to get around.;neutral
Please play around with it.;neutral
click the subversion commits tab.;neutral
+1 For this new design.;neutral
I don't know what Lucene's position is on Maven but am interested pursuing whatever makes sense.;neutral
I think MINA is more of a 'server framework' rather than an 'NIO framework'.. it is so close to being both.;neutral
filtering hooked up through Solr already and it would be dead simple to bring in here too but it would fit nicely in this framework.;neutral
It is pretty close to what you are proposing.;neutral
Oh and not to forget.;neutral
Pretty much every deserialization error shows up as an IOException.;neutral
However given the factored out code is pretty trivial I decided to duplicate it in favour of not adding another set of classes along with the additional complexity introduced (e.g.;neutral
I'll take care of this.;neutral
Yet now one must care for the relative ordering in between both icons too.;neutral
And it also will add a lot of complexity to the framework development/maintenance.   ;neutral
Adding a different patch.;neutral
Patch that changes progress computation to use position in input stream.;neutral
"Closest example that I can recall were questions about ""The Software shall be used for Good not Evil"" clause from the JSON License.";neutral
Fixed by updating to the new frameworks bridge 1.0.1-dev.;neutral
:)  > except at much worse performance.;neutral
* This is needed since the MappingTool fails if it gets non-persistent capable classes.;neutral
I'm just throwing it out there.;neutral
I agree with Sami that this should be contributed to Tika and that we delegate the language identification handling in Nutch to Tika just as we are doing or planning to for the MimeType and the parsing ;neutral
I have retested it and I figured out that I have posted the wrong parameters in the bug description.;neutral
Not  ideal but not too bad );neutral
Trunk for patch pretty much.;neutral
I think that would be the cleanest solution to prevent bad behaviour with wrong codecs?;neutral
Perhaps it would be easier to make ClobLocatorInputStream a wrapper around ClobLocatorReader and ClobLocatorOutputStream a wrapper around ClobLocatorWriter?;neutral
I like having consistent indenting but now it is really hard to see the diffs and it gets confusing.;neutral
> Ideally we would move to NIO framework like netty but that would much larger effort.;neutral
Once all the chunks have been uploaded the Upload Framework can returned a combined file.;neutral
You don't see '>' replaced because that's not required in this case (though some frameworks do it anyway).;neutral
I've reverted this for the moment.;neutral
Maybe we're stuck with it until log4j fixes its dependencies? ;neutral
Mladen any progress please?;neutral
I'll see if I can arrange for the manifest to contain bundle-manifestVersion. ;neutral

I only needed to let MarkupResourceStream also implement it.;neutral
It seems to work fine for me when i test locally the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through  cachekey -> locationstring -> markup  So if locationString doesn't work we get this:  cachekey -> cachekey -> markup  But i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...  should we include this into 1.3.2?;neutral

It will be available in 1.2_05.;neutral
the configuration in the POM works fine with 2.4.3.;neutral
I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.;neutral
I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.;neutral
This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.;neutral
This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().;neutral
If so then I would recommend adding a third index.;neutral
Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table.;neutral
See for instance the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.;neutral
EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.;neutral
DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods.;neutral
See previous comments for earlier commit.;neutral

"Since the ""Approved Requirements"" screen paginates the requirements I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier simply because the application operates a page at a time.";neutral
This annoys my suppliers a bit.;neutral
I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate) but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).  ;neutral
I did that first but then remembered that when I did that in the past people were unable to apply my patches w/o doing the svn move themselves.;neutral

Do more modern version of the Flash player work 11.3- 11.6?;neutral

The patch is horribly out-of-date.;neutral
Not sure if it is reasonable - is it possible to use the classes from HDFS-4979 here.;neutral
An email snafooey caused us to update our JIRA instance to 6.1 before we had a chance to test the import on our test instance (it didn't work properly for those who tried to whack at it).;neutral
I hope you can figure out how to upgrade and if you have any questions or need help feel free to reach out to us.;neutral
However if that schedule does not work for you please feel free to take this issue into your queue and go ahead.;neutral
It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.;positive
If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow then in the metatables doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent we'd have to scan to the next row).;neutral
If we were using scans prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).;neutral
can we apply the jarjar solution only to commons-csv?;neutral
If it was not was the attempt Id 1 killed explicitly?;neutral

Sweet I will review and apply.;positive
Probably makes sense to do these like HDFS-4014 sensitive changes get their own patch and the general new classes of warning can be handled in bulk in a small set of patches.;neutral

Am I missing the connection or is this a distinct issue?;neutral
More variations add significant long-term compatibility burdens to the project.;neutral
We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable.;neutral
So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.;neutral
Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile.;neutral
Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation.;neutral
The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.;neutral
We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use less fragile and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools.;neutral
I'm glad we were able to resolve this issue.;positive
May be i have the current PUT with me and from which i form the new PUTs to be added thro coprocessor hooks to a new region.;neutral
;neutral
Please provide your suggestions;neutral
+1 in my mind the -ROOT- table is very important of routing the right RegionServer of .META.;neutral
Thus i quite agree that we put the .META.;neutral
Note: the attached patch does not break the existing API;neutral
What would you think of just exposing incRef() & decRef() as expert public methods?;neutral
#NAME?;neutral
We would just add ensureOpen() to those methods and make them public.;neutral
The zip is already large and contains all code.;neutral
Using maven you can easily generate the docs yourself.;neutral
Or even better: use the maven repository to automatically attach the sources-jar to your eclipse/idea/netbeans project.;neutral
The comparison with 1.2.6 is not valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project..;neutral
With this client project i can't get connect with the webservice published in a Apache-tomcat-5.5.25.;neutral

The patch went in a few days ago:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=499521  ;neutral
Test code added as part of HDFS-2131;neutral
If I commit it as-is we could miss some help.;neutral
Patch to address the issue.;neutral
I have found the source of the problem - yet I completely don't understand why such an unrelated thing breaks navigation.;neutral
As soon as I remove wicket enclosure or add some text node inside - the navigation toolbar starts properly counting pages (it was showing 0 of 0 before because it thinks it is not visible in hierarchy).;neutral
Also adds the tests to the _Suite class.;neutral
"I've modified the patch to name the function rep.normalize  If you think that my proposal is actually not enough ambitious for being called ""normalization"" do you prefer something like rep:toASCII which may seem less universal ?";neutral
The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported.;neutral
It only breaks if j14lib is not set.;neutral
The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10.;neutral
I attached our resolvers sadly we have no file system resolvers because our repository is hosted on a central server.;neutral
"[ext]"" so we should fullfil the requirements for the atomic operation.";neutral
Is it planned to add the atomic feature to all resolvers?;neutral
I deleted the local hbase directory and the problem went away.;neutral
Does this mean the migrate tool is busted for this version?;neutral
Applying both patches results in clean tests (jdbc4 tests and derbyall modulo wisconsin noise).;neutral
Aha thanks for the information. That makes sense. Glad to hear that it helped! :);positive
Yeah that one (TestAtomicOperation) has me worried a bit.;neutral
And new we've had two failures within a few days.;neutral
Patch integrated to trunk.;neutral
Doc update to correct FQCN.;neutral
Note: also change the use/effect of network connector dynamicOnly  - this flag had little effect but is now re-commissioned to indicate whether durable subs should be auto bridged (default) or whether they should be dynamic only.;neutral
if you want to view online there is a refreshed version here: wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc  for fragment see here  http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13doc/org/apache/wicket/markup/html/panel/Fragment.html;neutral
There are still some debugging prints that will go away in the final submission.;neutral
Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.;neutral
Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.;neutral
The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.;neutral
The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.;neutral
Has anyone opened an issue at http://bugs.sun.com yet?;neutral
But it'd still be nice to get the actual hotspot bug fixed.;neutral
"How about following the naming from Math.min() and Math.max(): public static Date min(Date date1 Date date2) public static Date max(Date date1 Date date2)  Alternatively when I read 'Returnes [sic] the least recent (oldest)"" why not call the methods oldest() and newest()";neutral
And compatibility test also ....;neutral
Murray that is exactly what I am proposing - having a separate org.apache.jspwiki.api -package and placing a number of existing manager classes into it as interfaces.;neutral
Or to be precise a mostly equivalent set of APIs JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext which the old API signatures do not mostly support.;neutral
I would also like us to start using WikiNames wherever useful.;neutral
We have so many people contributing in the code that API incompatibilities can creep in without anyone noticing.;neutral
(There is no PageManager at all there is a ContentManager which will have a very similar API but it will manage both pages and attachments.;neutral

Please have a look at the latest patch FELIX-3339_threaddump-as-inventoryprinter_FIXED.patch which correctly provides an InventoryPrinter implementation of Thread Dumper have a look at the attached Screen Shot 2013-05-23 at 3.02.24 PM.pdf to see it in action embedded in the WebConsole.;neutral
I hope you'll like it!;neutral
The patch looks good and the tests pass +1.;neutral
I agree there's a bug I just want to ensure any change still works correctly when CURRENT_USER name is passed in.;neutral
My assertion is that the username passed into these routines (without any modification) is equivalent to value of an username identifier in the SQL language after it has been parsed by the SQL engine.;neutral
Note that though how users names are represented in the derby.;neutral
* properties may or may not match how a SQL engine would store them.;neutral
in a CREATE USER statement.;neutral
"They are created by setting properties and are thus not ""stored in the SQL engine"".";neutral
These blockers and critical issues are resolved but not verified.;neutral
So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code.;neutral
Sounds good.;neutral
A workaround for this issue is to use entity resolver.;neutral
You may close this issue.;neutral
We do not have to block this jira on the unit tests but we should probably try and get that in sooner than later.;neutral
Brilliant feedback thanks! I'm glad you found the issue and the solution!;positive
bq. First of welcome :) Thank you. ;positive
Excellent work Do??acan - thank you.;positive
To me this is intersection.;neutral
JUnit test and Patch provided;neutral
Let's be vague about what that entails right now.;neutral
3) If you do opt-in then you get the SQL standard behavior:     3a) Jar ids are mandatory.;neutral
Note also that an implementation goal is to not spawn threads to do writes to the underlying transport (like TFileTransport does now). ;neutral
Thanks.;neutral
In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all).;neutral
Also the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns which are search side.;neutral
My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now) but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%).;neutral
We have no cache evictions at all but a 99% hit ratio.;neutral
The sizes may be higher than you need then.;neutral
I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM.;neutral
I'd like to get them cleaned up because there are now so many that other more important and/or meaningful warnings are likely to be ignored.;neutral
Some amount of searching later...;neutral

To answer your questions in order: This problem only happens with the embedded driver because the Database is created inside the JVM and locked to prevent other processes to connect to it.;neutral

In general one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.;neutral
So back to your statement a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.;neutral
It does incur extra system calls but uses less memory which is a tradeoff.;neutral

22.2 close(): Could we rename it to shutdown to map startup()?;neutral
This looks good but I wish there was a good way to set up a test case.;neutral
I guess the best way would be to create a JobTracker and call the heartbeat method and observe the requested heartbeat interval.;neutral
I included the gen stamp and length in the {{cacheReport}} to handle caching newly appended data.;neutral
I also agree that jittering doesn't matter as much if it's ticking on such a short time scale.;neutral
However since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports let's just ape how block reports work don't jitter the incremental reports but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval.;neutral
Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092) if this sounds good I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items.;neutral
Stopping' gets us closer to classic Lifecycle.;neutral
You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.;negative

The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.;negative
32 bit ubuntu 12.10;neutral
Marking this for 0.18.4 and above since it's a deadlock.;neutral
The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions.;neutral
This blocker/ critcal was created before July please review and resolve we are approaching 4.2 code freeze in 7 days ;neutral
Was fixed to behave as it used to.;neutral
Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner.;negative
I recently stumbled upon a C++ey STLey impl -> http://code.google.com/p/patl/  bq.;neutral

Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it);negative
I dumped the txnlog from zookeeper2 here is the section of interest.;neutral
Fixed a typo in the oritinal patch.;neutral

I've rework almost all needed messages in Preconditions.checkArgument.;neutral
And I did it according the style of each class.;neutral
"Example for case: Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0 ""size must be at least 0"") we can do like Preconditions.checkArgument(size >= 0 ""Wrong size: "" + size + "".";neutral
@Joy: I agree that not losing heartbeats is the best scenario.;neutral
In the case I mentioned in my above comment we would not lose datanode heartbeats if we implement HDFS-1392.;neutral
"On the other hand if there is a true network partition then NN will ""lose heartbeats"" from datanodes because the datanodes cannot send messages to the NN.";neutral
So the heuristic that I listed above to detect a network partition should still be applicable isn't it?;neutral

The unit test code is for a sleep job where splits need not be different since they are empty.;neutral
Sorry should have commented on this much sooner.;negative
The preliminary patch is attached.;neutral
"Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ""ordered - cancelled = quantity"" which equates to ""1 - 1 = 0"".";negative

I don't have the cycles today.;neutral
Thanks.;neutral
As mentioned there to fix the issues blueprint code that calls out to any kind of client code (reference listeners service listeners initialiser methods) should not hold the full BlueprintRepository lock which allows deadlocks like the two observed.;neutral
Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook kicking in at the same time.;neutral
The patch should be licensed to ASF for inclusion in ASF works.;neutral
Though we have to review that usage in general.;neutral
Thanks for the reviews Bikas and Aaron.;neutral

Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think);negative

And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed (or when it is it is blamed on Microsoft.;negative
Haven't explicitly tested it myself.;neutral

yes they should all be using RWLock absolutely.;neutral
Mac looks like the tests are failing (especially TestHarFileSystem).;negative
Is there any particular reason on using an _ in front of the following variables?;neutral

Sorry we are no longer using Xerces.;negative
GenericData.getSchemaName instead throws an AvroRuntimeException so the special handling of UnresolvedUnionException in Responder.respond is skipped and the nested exception text is the result.;neutral
Another option is to create a new type for HdfsLocatedFileStatus as {code} HdfsLocatedFileStatusProto {   HdfsFileStatusProto fs = 1   LocatedBlocksProto locations = 2 } {code}   ;neutral
I have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that I believe must be related to this issue.;negative
Good idea especially if you have a use case for that.;positive
You might also want to consider the induced latency though depending on the checkpoint size and frequency.;neutral

How do we make sure we are matching the right hostnames?;neutral
most recently computed K partitions) but I switched to the model with K-1 partitions always in memory and 1 slot for loading out-of-core partitions because it made the logic slightly simpler.;neutral
I would keep the hasActive field in memory (in the PartitionStore).;neutral
We start with any K in-memory partitions skip on-disk partitions that have no active vertices or incoming messages and prioritize spilling partitions that have no active vertices.;neutral
Yes I will open a new jira for this sometimes :);neutral

16-byte BigInteger is overkill all we need is a reasonable distribution (now that Tokens don't need to be unique) and 64 or even 32 bits is plenty for that.;neutral
