15330;neutral;As of r438174 
15698;neutral;I believe this is an issue. I have an action saveAction which I want to chain to editAction whenever there is a validation error. This is often necessary because a JSP will be displayed which has dynamic content such as a selectable list of items. However
15793;neutral;This has been fixed in CVS. You can get the latest xwork.jar (which fixes the problem) from http://ivyrep.opensymphony.com
15801;negative;Given the dependencies
15893;neutral;You are only flushing the writer
16633;neutral;This was fixed by having all the items in the action chain having their properties copied over to the new action.

164568;neutral;planning to fix this.. I am planning to remember completed containers (only id) at node manager for predefined time (10min). Does that time sounds reasonable or we should make it configurable? ... I don't really think adding a new configuration parameter will be a good idea but I am open for any different approach / adding conf .. thoughts? This will have a similar implementation like YARN-62 but only difference is that YARN-62 only tracks container for a time after it starts to avoid duplicate launch..where as this tries to avoid logging errors for valid stop attempts...

178327;neutral;Hi Jochen  It's not about building successfully (which I have no issue with that as well) it's about resolving the right dependencies of the dependency.

The code I have as written does have the pluggable handler notion since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers or anything like that

247154;neutral;Hmm.  Breaking #if($query.foo) compatibility isn't ok if we can't find a reasonable way to keep that and the sub then i'll ditch the sub.   But i much prefer $query.foo.bar over $query.get('foo.bar') so i'm not going to give that up quickly.  The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion then you may as well just put the source map into the context.  Anyway i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.  If i can't then expect me to resurrect the sub in a later version where complete backwards compatibility isn't necessary.

307493;positive;I'm still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity.  I'll just point a few things out.  1/ I didn't veto anything and this has nothing to do with C++.  I think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added.  This in dangerous in the long term.  2/ I have no problem reverting this change.  3/ Restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea.

Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think?

327578;positive;Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan
330039;positive;Thank Henri and Don!  I found there are two common-validator.jar in my jboss application server env. One in %JBOSS_HOME%/server/default/lib/ and the other in the lib directory of my web application. Then I delete the latter and it works well.   Thank you so much!

336319;neutral;"Now the following tag:  <html:javascript dynamicJavascript=""false"" staticJavascript=""true"" />  Always adds  <script .....>  ... </script>.  I thought that staticJavascript purpose was to allow things like:  <script src=""<html:rewrite page='/staticJs.jsp' />"" type=""text/javascript""></script>  And create a jsp with something like:  <%@ page language=""java"" contentType=""text/javascript"" %> <%@ taglib uri=""struts-html"" prefix=""html"" %> <html:javascript dynamicJavascript=""false"" staticJavascript=""true"" />  And take profit of browsers cache.  No this is broken. As a workaround   <jsp:include page=""/staticJs.jsp"" flush=""true"" />  can be used but this hasn't any benefint over generating both static and dynamic javascript in the same tag (except form multiple forms per page)   If this is the intended behaviour I'm sorry for reopenning the bug.

342623;negative;Hi Rupert!   Sorry it took so long but i thought i'd test building in a linux environment too so i set up a Centos 6.3 machine running Maven 3.0.4 and Java 1.6_41.

362105;neutral;Hi which version do I need to apply the patch on?  
366358;neutral;First draft.  This just does the mapping in the constructor to the comparator.  We could do setNextReader but I can't imagine it will really make much difference given the small number of items that we typically would expect to be elevated.
366522;neutral;I created a class that extends UpdateRequestProcessor which logs calls to each method. In the console output you'll see that only the processAdd methods are called when using the DIH in debug mode and the user checks verbose and commit.  I've attached the SOLR configuration that can be used to replicate the issue. I'm assuming that once Lucene commits the files the UpdateRequestProcessor.processCommit method should be called too.   *UpdateRequestProcessorTest.class*  package org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport

371242;neutral;The DismaxRequestHandler and StandardRequestHandler are both deprecated and replaced with SearchHandler.     
371315;neutral;bq. Actually DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH – I'm not sure what value it will bring.   I've got a sharded index
371455;neutral;"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms) I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).   So I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting I'm interested. "

381031;neutral;"Of course I totally agree with Yonik.  I don't care that much what the default include is (upper lower ...) as long as it doesn't double-count. Double-counting is bad -- it can lead to a bad user experience. There's something about ""lower"" that I feel makes it slightly better than ""upper"" but I can't really explain the rationale. I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).  Just because its easy to set the include doesn't mean the default is arbitrary.  Any way if the default remains to double-count I'm going to insist that my readers for the second edition of my book change this value."

401129;positive;Guillaume  I took a quick look at your suggestions.  I agree that we can reduce the code a bit.

455054;positive;committed to trunk. Thanks [~elserj]!
455643;positive;[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.

466700;positive;Patch committed to trunk. Thanks Niraj.
467084;positive;bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this? Thanks
467290;positive;"Hi Gianmarco Thanks for your concern. Actually we need one additional step to make bin/pig work. We shall copy $PIG_HOME/build/pig-0.8.0-dev.jar to $PIG_HOME/pig-0.8.0-core.jar. This will be handled in ant's ""package"" target when releasing. But if you check out from svn we will do this additional step to work with bin/pig."
467392;positive;Patch is committed to the trunk. Thanks Niraj.
470416;neutral;Just back from vacation. Have updated the code with required changes. It should be good to go now. Pradeep can you or any other committer review it ?  
471677;neutral;Patch was commited on May 13 2009.

476298;neutral;Antonio could you just create a patch file that I can apply.
476380;neutral;Totally agree. I don't see any good reason why Pig should require 1.6 at this stage. Don't make it harder for the users (and developers under OSX - that includes me) than it already is.
477037;positive;>Tilman Hausherr   hello finally it  works! I just downloaded the revision 1535956 and bulded it with Ant. and added the new *.jar to my project's build path. it printed very well.  thank you very much.
477615;neutral;"I've revised DateConverter to conform to java 6:      changed isAlphabetic to isDigit (and reversed the ?: values)      use SimpleDateFormat(""Z"") as Tilman suggested.  Also fixed some Javadoc in both DateConverter and TestDateUtil"

479828;negative;I'm afraid one can't extract the text from the given pdfs. Both are using fonts with a non human readable encoding and as there isn't included any mapping you'll get rubbish instead of the text. Even the acrobat reader can't extract the text.

485723;neutral;If you run the train command you get an error in the model serializer I suggest to train on the ppa data set serialize the model and then load it again to ensure there are no runtime errors in this code path.

514247;positive;Hi Tri  Those files looks good. I cursorily checked only.CommonUiLabels.xml.patch but from their sides I guess the others are good as well. But done from the OFBiz roo directory it's the main OFBiz directory where you fine the LICENSE and APACHE2_HEADER files. Anyway not a big deal I will try to apply them as is and will let you know  You don't have to remove the old files as you can see they are now grayed and it's good that you checked the grant license box.

528726;positive;Sorry Jacques I have not seen that it was a grouped bugs.  In this case I have used to set in the grouped bugs the sum of the components used by detailed issues.  I didn't like unknow components.  Otherwise we can add a new fictitious component - GROUPED ISSUES - and assign this component to this type of issue.   Thanks  Marco  
528964;positive;Marco BTW I have only helped Santosh Malviya for OFBIZ-1468 where ever he needs and reviewed his work. After that Its only his effort to convert java to minilang + testing the patch. So majority of credit goes to Santosh Malviya :)

541585;neutral;Could you make sure that the following path exists on your machine:  C:\Program Files\Apache\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\ode\WEB-INF/jpadb  It sometimes happen that Tomcat for some reason fails to open the WAR which results in an incomplete deployment.
542796;neutral;i don't think that any special filtering should be performed for the access control content such as e.g. rep:policy nodes. but as far as i can see you didn't incorporate this into the patch right?  testing for Tree#exists in the NodeDelegate looks ok to me...
544276;positive;that's nice! The patch looks good Emanuele :)
544652;neutral;Further optimized caching in KernelNodeStore a bit in revision: 1450145  The test now just runs for a very long time (with -Xmx128m) and didn't run out of memory so far on my machine. Though it is still working on 51200 child nodes after it reported '25600 nodes in 1440293 ms'.

562151;neutral;Actually i made a simple test on 2 small linkdb and i didn't see any improvment. You're right. There is no need to add it.
562657;neutral;"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch which I find quite elegant.   Some improvements to the patch would be  - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher delete HitDetailer and SearchBean  - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile HTMLLanguageParserLanguageIdentifier... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see we do not need any metadata for Solr backend and only need StoreIndex and Vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement :   {code} class FieldMeta { o.a.l.document.Field.Store store"
565199;positive; Hi Luca  I've applied the changes you mentioned and it worked fine on my end (Windows).  Can you try this on your end as well? I've attached the patch.  Thanks!
567127;neutral;Re: setReaderThread I didn't know we had such a method.  It looks like it was added here: http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-commons/net/src/java/org/apache/commons/net/telnet/TelnetClient.java?rev=1.9&view=markup  Other than adding documentation to FTPClient about this it sounds like like there isn't any other action to take on this report???

574480;neutral;HI Ronald  The fix I put in on the 30th caused pages to stop drawing in the RC1.  I have reverted part of the fix for this bug to get 657 resolved. Could you please take a look at the comments for 657 and test out the head of the 1.1.1 branch to make sure that this version works for your case.

577994;neutral;I can confirm this is not happening on Ubuntu 12.04 with OpenJDK 1.6.0_24. Did anyone get a chance to look at this apparently Mac-specific issue?
578043;positive;"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each.  - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...   As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. "

601204;neutral;Hi Jason! I was thinking one of those parameters was the time the NM should wait before sending the SIGTERM. Alas I was wrong ContainerLaunch.java:337 sends the SIGTERM pretty much instantly. That is messing me up in MAPREDUCE-4135.  I'm still thinking having a small time delay before sending even the SIGTERM should be good. If we can do it on the NM and not on the RM I think we might be able to conserve RM resources. 
601669;negative;Sorry looks like we took to long to get to this the patch no longer applies.  Can you please upmerge to latest?
602004;neutral;Can you please address the findbugs warning. (inconsistent synchronization)  I did a quick look at your patch and I am a bit confused by the implementation of setSignaled.  I realize that you did not really change the code at all but is there a reason that the parameter is ignored?  If you don't know I can look into it myself.

644706;neutral;"(If it's just reading ints I was thinking just write 4-byte ints. That's got to be the fastest of all.)  The author would be Ted really his call. If it's more of an example for the book it could be attached to the book. If it stays that's cool too just need to have a think about fixing/documenting the issues raised here.  You've raised a different an interesting point about performance though. You find that the slow-down is actually in addToVector where it converts a String to byte[]? The thing is the corresponding line in the ""fast"" version skips this step and adds null.  Indeed also passing null in the ""normal"" version makes it twice as fast for me. It's still twice as slow as the ""fast"" version though. But I do wonder whether the example deserves a bit more attention. I may not know what I'm doing. Is that a difference that shouldn't exist between the two benchmarks?"

647358;neutral;Just some variations
647618;neutral;"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So no you didn't add this but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code}   echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  "
650567;neutral;The inline patch came out garbled. Same patch attached.
651307;neutral;It could have been created as a patch and that is far as its gotten.   Assuming that we're talking we're just talking about creating a simple .snk to create strongly named assemblies when talking about signing assembly:  I didn't see a .snk file in the Lucene.Net_2_9_4g branch when setting up the build scripts. I haven't looked in trunk yet.    The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.  Someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a 2.9.2 version using the snk whenever the next release does come out.    
652642;positive;Hi DIGY  I like to know a bit more about this patch:  1) what test case is it fixing? 2) how did you determine the race condition?  The changes to the ThreadClass is considerable and I'm trying to understand why this wasn't a problem in earlier versions.  Thanks.  -- George 
652698;positive;I rather we don't work on older versions.  If this is still an issue in 2.3.1 please submit a new patch for 2.3.1.  Thanks.
656018;positive;"Patch looks great!  Thanks Artem.  No more mixing in of fuzzy-ness into AnalyzingSuggester.  It looks like we are doing the utf8 conversion + det twice per lookup once in convertAutomaton and once in getFullPrefixPaths.  But I think this is inevitable: the first conversion is on the ""straight"" automaton for exactFirst match and the second one is on the lev automaton for non-exactFirst.  Really we should only do the first convertAutomaton if exactFirst is true ... but this is an optimization so we don't need to fix it now. "

658276;positive;Thanks for raising these documentation issues! I just committed a fix.
659082;neutral;Following the recent facets work I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):  * Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600) and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one but it looks like we can get rid of it too.
660764;neutral;"I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089 though I just used a Map<StringString>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<StringString> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road. "
662724;neutral;I commented out the assertion for this test ... it's not valid.
663127;positive;Thanks Scott. git formatted patches are fine in my opinion: lets get this fixed
665037;neutral;Patch adds maybeRefreshBlocking which blocks on refreshLock. It also:  * Renames reopenLock to refreshLock * Shares the refresh logic between maybeRefresh and maybeRefreshBlocking. * Switches to use ReentrantLock instead of Semaphore(1): ** It allows to protectively obtain the lock in doMaybeRefresh (see comment in the code) ** It is better in general because it's equivalent to Semaphore(1) yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes Semaphore(1) to Semaphore(>1).  I'll add a CHANGES entry after the patch is reviewed and we agree on the approach.
665610;positive;Committed.  Thanks Chris!
666339;neutral;"lemme see if I can help with the test. I feel bad I didn't supply one with the prototype patch.  About the Solr integration: this looks good! We can use a similar approach for autosuggest too so this could configure the analyzer for LUCENE-3842.  I wonder if we should allow separate configuration of ""index"" and ""query"" analyzers? I know I came up with some use-cases for that for autosuggest but I'm not sure about spellchecking. I guess it wouldn't be overkill to allow it though."
667478;neutral;"bq. I assumed modules doesn't need to be self-contained like Lucene or Solr. I can fix that by enforcing tools' compilation in that macro... I'll do that. bq. Steve will you double check again if everything works  Yes everything works for me now thanks!  bq. and commit this in?  Is there some reason why you can't do this?  IMO committers should commit their own work.  bq. I didn't put an entry into CHANGES so you'd have to add it if it qualifies at all to be mentioned there.  IMO this definitely warrants a CHANGES.txt entry.  This should also be backported to branch_3x.  bq. This reminds me of the ""infrastructure tools"" problem we had in Carrot2. We finally decided to simply have them as a stand-alone project living within the same repository space with a stored versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated (rarely). This does version a binary file but you don't need to worry about recompiling things over and over.  +1 to do this for this and any other Lucene/Solr Ant tasks."
668028;positive;"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  "
668427;neutral;From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a “clone‿ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy – we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/… which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. That’s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. It’s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer that’s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap – both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole “message‿ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....

673371;neutral;Previous patch was wrong. Here a new one.
674611;neutral;"bq. Hmmm infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile?  I'll remove its volatile...  {quote} bq. IWC cannot be made immutable – you build it up incrementally (new IWC(...).setThis(...).setThat(...)). Its fields cannot be final.  Setters can return modified immutable copy of 'this'. So you get both incremental building and immutability. {quote}  Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay Mark me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think secondary ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. "

676725;negative;bq. I'm gonna hold off on LUCENE-2771 until we figure this one out... because it would make your getSequentialSubReaders in the synced=true case quite heavy (without modifications).

677876;positive;+1 patch looks good. 
678686;neutral;Ported back to 3.x  Committed revision 991537.
679428;positive;"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... "
681206;positive;Good catch!  Thanks for the thorough explanation and suggestions.  I think it all makes sense.  Will work on a patch.
681898;neutral;Yes I'm continuing along the path Chris started with his first patch mine is coming soon.  Nikola
682463;neutral;There is a bug in PayloadNearQuery. If there are multiple top level spans that match the query only the payloads of the first one are retrieved. This patch fixes this bug by iterating over all the top level spans to get the payloads (see 'setFreqCurrentDoc')  > The base explain method can't be abstract. Something like Ah right. This is included in the patch  >The changes don't seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables. It may still be all right but have you looked at this aspect?  I guess that could be said about PayloadTermSpanScorer and PayloadNearSpanScorer too (payloadScore payloadsSeen). As for the PayloadFunction classes they seem lightweight enough to be created with each query. Is there a better pattern?  Peter   
683340;positive;Looks like a good solution!  Thanks for taking care of this Uwe!  {quote} Should we backport this to 2.9 and 3.0 (which is easy)? {quote}  +1
684142;positive;bq. If you back-port this to 2.9 you can't use any of the java.util.concurrent.* Very good point! - didn't thought about back porting at all.   bq. I'm not sure you need a separate SearcherHolder class - can't you re-use IndexReader's decRef/incRef? I guess I did not see the simplicity the reader offers - blind due to  java.util.concurrent.* :)  bq. I think there are some thread safety issues..  this is weird - on my dev machine and in the patch it is not synchronized.. on the machine I run the tests it is. Anyway you are right.   I changed the code to be compatible with 2.9 using indexReaders.dec/incRef.. will attache in a minute   
685632;neutral;fixed to use reader.termDocs(null) for delete check.

Workaround for me was to remove the Aries Proxy 0.3 bundle shipped with Fuse ESB and install Aries Proxy 0.3.1. After I did that and restarted the container the problem was resolved for me.
720303;positive;Red color isn't really important it was just a suggestion to be more homogeneous ... but that can be revisited in a different jira. I agree an option is a good idea for automatically acknowledging hosts.  Not sure what the default should be: the current behavior is obviously to not confirm so we could keep that one or go for a safer one I don't have any strong opinion on that.

727466;neutral;Quick fix to interchange the order of constructor arguments of ClientIdAndTopic.
727470;negative;Sorry for the late review. Have a few minor questions/comments.  60. What happens if have 2 instances of Consumers with the same clientid in the same jvm? Does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics? Ditto for Producers.  61. ConsumerTopicStats: What if a topic is named AllTopics? We use to handle this by adding a - in topic specific stats.  62. ZookeeperConsumerConnector: Do we need to validate groupid?  63. ClientId: Does the clientid length need to be different from topic length?  64. AbstractFetcherThread: When building a fetch request do we need to pass in brokerInfo as part of the client id? BrokerInfo contains the source broker info and the fetch requests are always made to the source broker.  
729434;neutral;Thanks for getting started on this. I have a couple of requests -  1. Could you please upload a patch to this JIRA and grant it to Apache ?  2. This patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would ?   It will make it much easier for us to review it.   Also when you said the zk connect option hangs did you get a chance to take a look at the debug/trace logs to see where it hangs ? Do you mind uploading those log files here ?
731872;neutral;Hi ShengTao you would think if you follow:  1. Check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. Then add a bindingTemplate.  Then you would not be overwriting a bindingTemplates. You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there. The current behavior is how the UDDI v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec.  Please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues.   --Kurt

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards

876803;positive;I've just committed this to the HDFS-347 branch.  Thanks a lot for the contribution Colin.
876863;positive;The patch looks good to me. Some minors:  1. javadoc for two getINode() in SnapshotDiffList.java  2. We have DirectoryDiff ChildrenDiff Diff SnapshotDiff this is a little bit hard to follow. How about some renaming like SnapshotDiffForDirectory SnapshotDiffForFile?  3. SnapshotDiff#combinePosterior(final D posterior final BlocksMapUpdateInfo collectedBlocks)    can be renamed to deletePosterior or combineAndDeletePosterior so as to distinguish with Diff#combinePosterior? 
877358;neutral;On second thought I removed the patch. This would just be working around the problem. I could live with a verdict that this dev environment is broken in some way that I'm just not seeing. Or there is another option that avoids what looks like an enumeration over local addresses for reverse lookups (including virbr networks). Since this is all localhost testing mocking the resolver is not unreasonable.
878313;neutral;One more comment this should be in the incompatible section in CHANGES.txt.
879562;positive;"The latest patch looks pretty good to me.

891841;neutral;Hi colin I agree that scatter/gather typically refers to multiple input tuples of (position length). Yes we can extend the api to include that.  The reason my original proposal did not include that was because I was mostly targetting this api to reduce the number of buffer copies.

900454;neutral;Duplicate of HDFS-2321
901112;positive;I just committed this to trunk. Thank you Uma.  The patch does not apply to 0.23 branch any more. I recommend it for back porting.
901903;neutral;Remove from 0.20.205 in hopes that HDFS-2342 did indeed fix TestHdfsProxy.testHdfsProxyInterface.
903101;positive;Thanks a lot for fixing those issues Alejandro. I re-ran all the tests I ran last night and everything worked great.  Additionally I tried out test-patch.sh which seemed to work flawlessly.  +1 patch looks good to me.
904326;positive;Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.
905010;positive;Great I think we are all on the same page then! We'll move forward down this route. Thanks for taking a look.
905436;positive;I have committed this.  Thanks CW!
906562;positive;I have committed the patch for trunk.  Thanks Tanping!
908835;neutral;Here's a potential fix for this. close() and hflush() now may throw InterruptedIOException if the thread has interrupt status. It's a bit tricky because they won't *always* throw it - if they weren't going to block they will return immediately (with interrupt status preserved)
913040;neutral;Todd I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it the namespace should be locked (for modifications) so the edits go into journal spool which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished. Please see the design doc in HADOOP-4539.
913188;positive;"Hi Hairong the speedups you measured with this patch are very impressive.  It would be great to have it included in the system.  The patch still applied successfully to current trunk when I tried it.  So can you please go ahead and ""submit patch"" so we see how it does with test-patch?  And I'll review it and try to get someone else to also.  Thanks!"

935735;positive;Thanks
939053;neutral;This looks like it needs rebased onto trunk.  The posted patch includes generated code ({{AdminProtos.java}}) please remove.  Please add javadoc for the new classes and new public methods on existing classes.  {{FavoredNodeAssignmentHelper#placeSecondaryAndTertiaryWithRestrictions}} introduces a {{while(true)}} block containing non-trivial branching logic. Can this be refactored with simpler and/or clearer break conditions?  {{FSUtils}} introduces new configuration {{hbase.client.localityCheck.threadPoolSize}}. Can this be added to {{HConstants}} and/or documented in {{hbase-defaults.xml}}?
939608;positive;I've committed this to 0.940.95 and trunk. Thanks for the patch gautam. 
942607;positive;Hi Ted Matteo  Thanks for the review.  The commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to 'rescue' some exceptions. It will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more ... The approach to expand (instead of shrink) this logic is not a bad or ugly one ...  But your suggested solution is fine.   
943989;positive;Looks like the 0.95 issues are timeout related...should be good to go.
953205;neutral;The same appears to be try for case_studies.xml community.xml and zookeeper.xml. Should those not be copied for some other reason?

967599;positive;Thanks for the finding Andrey.  createDir() is recursive. Would be nice to write it in iterative manner.  Would FileSystem.mkdirs() do the job ?
971947;neutral;Thanks Elliot! Did you forget to add FailedSanityCheckException to the 0.94 patch? If the same as in 0.96 I'll just add it at commit.  Will the new exception cause compatibility issues in old 0.92.x and 0.94.{0|1} clients? I don't think so... Just making sure.

1016110;neutral;It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :)
1016302;positive;Committed to branch and trunk thanks for the review Stack.
1017946;neutral;Fixed in HBASE-2156 after it was reopened.
1018276;positive;Sounds good. We'll postpone HBASE-2993 til then. Thanks!

1025430;neutral;This patch removes tohtml.xsl and adds configuration_to_docbook_section.xsl.  The latter generates a docbook section from our hbase-default.xml using maven-xml-plugin that runs before the docbook plugin.  Our book then xincludes the generated file (the patch includes this modification too).  Patch includes a edit of our book which adds a preface an index an appendix that talks of configuarion another on compression etc.

1037759;neutral;hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.  TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.

1061050;neutral;VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.

1073405;neutral;Andrey  I don't quite understand this patch.  For instance you didn't mention bcprov above but you remove some references to it in build/make/components/extra.xml and build/make/deploy.xml and confusingly the patch doesn't remove build/make/components/extra/bcprov.xml ?  This seems a little inconsistent.  Perhaps I'm missing something.

1152903;neutral;> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration.

1201196;neutral;change status from ASSIGNED to NEW for consistency
1202697;positive;Patch applied. Thanks a lot especially for the test case. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240459&view=rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240461&view=rev  The result for 180 and -180 is definitely wrong. There's a bug that needs to be fixed eventually. But since this is low-priority for me I'm going to leave it for now. I've added a comment to the new test case block-container4a that explains what is wrong. So I think I'll close this issue. It's primarily for the patch after all and the bug won't be missed now that there is a check in our test suite. If anyone disagrees just reopen the issue or create a new one.
1203934;positive;Applied.  Thanks Simon!
1206141;neutral;This is a java problem.
1207220;positive;Committed rev:088067c. Thanks Roman!
1207857;positive;I think you should get rid of the open-ended version spec [1.2) as it occasionally screws things up by bringing in snapshots or non-working code. Otherwise to my eyes it looks good.

1218432;positive;Thank you Carol!
1218950;positive;I took a quick look at D (unused locals).  Most of it looks good but I don't understand the few places where for backward compatibility there is what looks like a useless statement just to make sure a property gets read.  Won't someone else someday follow up with patch H that removes what seems to be useless code and just take those out anyway?
1320163;neutral;InstanceDescription can be extended with HandlerDescription without pain. Only problem is a contribution to ComponentTypeDescription by custom handlers. Simple slot for custom handlers to keep their information in displayable format would be sufficient.

1361520;neutral;Committed the 2a patch with revision 1187204.
1361901;negative;I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently.   
1362093;neutral;I think clearing private fields should work in all JVMs since that's what the call to f.setAccessible(true) is for. Those fields were final too before DERBY-23 and it looks like modifying final fields via reflection didn't work prior to Java 5 even when calling setAccessible() first. The tests also fail on 1.4.2 (both Sun and IBM).
1375057;neutral;Attaching a new patch that compiles without errors against JDK1.4.2.  It also accounts for the customizable port part (DERBY-4217) which the previous patch didn't.
1376572;positive;Hi Tiago  Thanks for looking at this issue.  On visual inspection of the change your text change looks fine. However I can't apply the patch. You need to svn diff from the top of the tree show it shows the path staring with java/engine/...  You should reopen the issue until it has been committed.  Also just for good measure you should run suites.All and derbyall  in case there are any canon updates needed.  Thanks  Kathey 
1376945;neutral;Oh one more thing on the tests. You have  if (JVMInfo.JDK_ID >= 6) {  ... test   should it b if (JVMInfo.JDK_ID >= 5) { ?  
1377368;positive;Changes look good. Could you run regression tests with your patch and let us know how it goes?  Thanks  Kathey 
1378819;positive;Junit patch committed Revision: 634284 - Thanks John.
1379859;positive;Thanks for double-checking the fix Knut. I am thinking of merging the fix into 10.3 tomorrow just to make sure that tests run fine on the tinderbox. All the tests ran fine on my machine.
1380731;positive;Hi Manjula I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null

1388894;neutral;"Dag commented (6/30/2011) on the commit of revision 1141368 - apparently replies on the commit messages don't make it back into JIRA so just for the record here is that comment: ""I didn't follow this one but I notice setUp and teardown do not call super.setUp super.tearDown respectively as per the idiom. Is there a reason for this here?  Notably BaseJDBCTestCase#tearDown does some cleaning up. It may not be required here but it's generally good to stick to the idiom.""  Houx Zhang replied: ""Yes Dag. I agree with you and will adopt it.""  Looks like Bryan already added super.teardown with revision 1141769. "
1391491;negative;Sorry for the noise I forgot to grant the license to previous attachment for inclusion in ASF works. Thanks
1392372;neutral;Assigning back to Dag.
1392412;positive;This looks like a fine approach to me. Thanks for putting the patch together. +1. 
1393704;neutral;The attached patch adds a test case to RestrictedVTITest that shows that the predicate is not pushed in the following query:      select s_r count(*) from table(integerList()) t group by s_r having s_r > 1  Only the rows with s_r > 1 have to be returned by the table function integerList so pushing the predicate could be useful.  Committed the new test case to trunk with revision 943088.
1395382;neutral;Closing as a duplicate of DERBY-3061 which is fixed in Derby 10.3.2.1.

1405014;neutral;Committed revision 568039.
1405105;positive;Hi Ramin  The patch looks good except I think it would be good to give import/export its own  SQLState starting with XIE instead of reusing the existing store FILE_EXISTS message.  Also it would be good to have test cases for writing the lob files.  Kathey 
1405292;neutral;"Reattaching with ""grant license..."""
1406087;neutral;It should be noted that the client driver already caches the LOB lengths (for both Clobs and Blobs). I planning to go ahead with the patch for StoreStreamClob in the embedded driver.
1407085;positive;Knut Anders thanks for the review and the good advice.  The attached patch rmTestPreparedStatementMethods_v2.diff should address your comments.
1411459;neutral;I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so I'll file a bug for that. 
1411823;neutral;Please find the attached screenshot for reference
1412190;neutral;Committed 3a with revision 506899.
1412407;positive;Thanks for the revision Jørgen! I think the release notes look good now. I will resolve the issue after a few days to allow for any feedback on Knut's suggestion.

1417277;neutral;I propose to commit drop_column_v8_restored_tests.diff. If there are any reviewers currently examining this patch please let me know. Unless any additional review comments are raised in the next 48 hours I will commit the patch.
1421490;positive;Hi Anurag  Thanks for the preliminary peek at this patch. Looks good. I like the way you handled the optional inclusion of the JDBC4-specific classes in the jar file. I recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress. Thanks for the explanation of why you disabled the SecurityManager and for commenting the property file accordingly. When we do commit this patch let's leave the JIRA open to remind us to re-enable the SecurityManager after mustang fixes its bug.  Cheers-Rick
1421523;positive;The patch looks good and the tests ran cleanly. I reindented some parts of the code since they had twice as much indentation as the surrounding code (does your editor use tab width eight instead of four?).  Committed revision 396859.
1421807;neutral;Committed to trunk with revision 467578. Committed to 10.2 with revision 467580.

1423285;positive;Thanks for taking the time out to review the patch Bryan. Yes the patch is ready for commit unless someone else is reviewing it too. Thanks again.
1423751;positive;Thanks Kathey and Myrna. The release note looks good and it passes the ReleaseNoteReader's checks.
1424939;neutral;Kathey I think you should just go ahead and port the fix to 10.1.  Merge command:    svn merge -r 289538:289539 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk  I have started working on a general check-that-resources-are-freed test for DERBY-23 DERBY-210 and DERBY-557 but while doing that I ran into another resource leak (DERBY-594) that I wanted to resolve first.
1425944;neutral;Any thought of porting this patch to 10.1? I just ran derbyall on the 10.1 branch and this came up.
1429456;neutral;AfterDeploymentValidation#addDeploymentProblem failed. since we have DELTASPIKE-262 we should just enable it again for v0.4.
1433103;positive;Great thanks! 
1433941;negative;Thanks for accepting this patch. I'm sorry I wasn't sensitive to the brace convention already in the file. I probably could have javadoc'd the inner class too :)  I didn't think about the lack of thread safety of the SimpleDateFormat class: good catch. So this counts as a bugfix by markt (format was being used in an unsynchronized way prior to this patch) as well as an enhancement by me :)  If DBCP typically uses localized error messages I'd be happy to provide another patch that localizes the exception's message.

1439944;neutral;As soon as I made the change in Karaf I will submit the CXF patch.
1441302;positive;Hi Aki  I strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side which can expose the problem you mentioned and also verify your fix works.  Actually we already have ServerPersistenceTest and ClientPersistenceTest in systests/ws-specs I think you can add yours in those two classes.  Btw your suggestion seems ok for me.  Thanks Freeman
1441645;positive;Applied patch into trunk and cxf-2.2.x branch  with thanks to William.
1442147;neutral;Added patch generated from CXF 2.2.6
1442450;positive;Hi Charles thanks for the confirmation... We will chat with Willem I'm off today but will work for a couple of days this week... Sergey  
1445709;positive;  I've now ported the fix to 2.0.4 and deployed  a new snapshot.   Could someone give it a try to make sure it really is fixed so that we can close this off for 2.0.4?  Thanks!

1455325;neutral;Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but I’d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     …and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isn’t a make error. 
1455392;neutral;Dang just realized this might be hard.  Each individual node can't really predict when/where conflicts will happen. So how would it avoid compacting away the shared parent?
1455558;positive;I'm excited to see progress being made here but I have to agree with Joan the security of this concerns me even with the new sandbox.js you're putting together.
1455985;neutral;That's what reminded me of ubjson actually. I looked at UBF and it looks rather complicated for a data exchange. I wouldn't say no but I don't have any interest in supporting it.  ubjson shouldn't be anything more than writing a parser (which should be ~trivial) and then adding the logic to switch (de)serializers based on content and accept types. I have no idea what UBF really even is under the hood but it sounded a lot more complicated.
1457183;neutral;@Paul. Can we close this?
1457506;positive;Applied to master and branch 1.2.x. Thanks Klaus.

1467541;negative;Sorry for delay. This patch is including LRU cache. But changing static class into member is not done. What should I do?
1468812;negative;Hello Oliver  Sorry for the late response. I haven't had any time to look into this again maybe it was a misuse on my side after all. Since I haven't been working on the project I encountered the behavior in for months this issue might as well be closed.

1473279;neutral;There have been changes to the method updateCurrentIterator() between these versions that we need so we can't just reverse the change. I'd love to fix any bug that can be identified cleanly. For now though I'm placing this in NEEDINFO awaiting a test case.

1477427;neutral;Created an attachment (id=16279) Patch to add percentage-dimensions and jpep quality handling (against Trunk) 
1478766;neutral;Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.

Once I  get this answered (either here or in cocoon-users which I've also asked) I'll  close the bug. 
1484850;neutral;You should do conn.getObject(entry null). In the AtomPub case it's actually going to be optimized if the entry is already an APPObjectEntry and no futher remote repository access will be done.

1511492;neutral;The tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they don't seem to be the cause of the issue. Something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places. We need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place. It might be very well be releated to the security provider. Can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory?

1533314;neutral;I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately.  1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand they don't seem bad but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again actually I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that.
1533520;negative;Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.  BillingInfo and ShippingInfo each inherit from Address.  IIRC a runtime relationship was being created for Customer => Address which was messing things up.  I'll have to dig through the SVN history to see what I did with mandatory relationships that I mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission.
1534433;neutral;I was actually trying to debug the issue and didn't see anything that looked like it would nuke the DataMap/DataNode under the DataDomain and was wondering if it was a visual issue but didn't try saving the model to see if it had actually deleted it.  Something about all that information disappearing was unsettling.  This is definitely a post 1.2 thing I think.  Thanks! 
1536823;neutral;I don't think this is a bug -- you essentially moved files out from under a running instance something cassandra can't expect.  In the end sstablesplit should only be done offline.

1538047;positive;Looking at DataStax's 2.0.0 Debian packages the change didn't make its way in.  Digging deeper it's only on the cassandra-1.2 branch.  Can someone merge/cherry-pick it to cassandra-2.0 and trunk.  Thanks Blair 
1540035;neutral;"Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs."

1555229;neutral;"bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way  I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But I'm not sure ""check every N seconds starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?""  Any other ideas?"
1557184;neutral;"Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.  Also adds parallel compaction testing to LazilyCompactedRowTest.  CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).  Haven't figured out what's causing that and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge which may be relevant.  bq. I'm also no proposing to complicate things.    You're right poor choice of words on my part.  Latest gives the merge executor a SynchronousQueue.  I think that's a better way to cut worst-case than the Deserializer for the reason given previously.  bq. 'if...instanceof' business is a bit error prone/ugly  Agreed. Added getColumnCount + reset to ICountableColumnIterator sub-interface.  bq. say how multithreaded_compaction is different from concurrent_compactors and that multithread_compaction is likely only useful for SSDs in cassandra.yaml  done  bq. The bytesRead ""race"" should also be fixed in CompactionIterable  done  bq. I would have put the code in CompactedRow.close() at the end of the LCR.write() instead of adding a new method as it avoids forgetting calling close   I did consider that but it feels weird to me to have write implicitly call close.

1524565_2;negative;When you install a node module globally it goes into /usr/local where you don't have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo.
1537069_6;negative;That being said I'm not totally opposed to making the limit configurable.
1564457_4;negative;All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.
1569844_1;negative;Just to clarify... you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS...   Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?
1573478_1;negative;+1 (damn intellij it's not like patch format hasn't been standard for years)
1629017_7;negative;Here is quite bad.
1686065_2;negative;if so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy?
1687818_1;negative;It seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h() might no longer be used either e.g. ink_gettimeofday() is never used so lets get rid of that shit.
1690651_1;negative;Heh that's one hell of a bug 275 bytes exactly eh?
1769700_1;negative;What a stupid name I chose for that object... )-:
1778787_2;negative;I think it's time to just close this issue.

1808616_1;negative;Stupid Maven
1816305_3;neutral;If using a single FlatFileItemWriter it is enough to register it as an ItemWriter however when using the composite the adding it as a stream is also needed.

1858018_1;negative;The defect  from hell 666 be scared..
1990074_1;negative;Why the hell is this not a bug?
1990074_4;neutral;I'm confused...
2014921_2;negative;What the hell are you waiting for ?
2024396_1;neutral;you can't reopen stuff fixed in the past without upsetting JIRA.
2059085_3;neutral;I've fixed that locally and am doing a full build but I'm going to build a test case to duplicate the error and then verify my proposed fix corrects it.
2085431_2;negative;It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies.
2127189_2;negative;This sucks *so much*...
2132048_1;negative;Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.
2132543_1;negative;*Damn* I forgot.
2148299_4;negative;Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.
2162609_1;negative;It sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay.
2181040_11;negative;And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup.
2194394_1;negative;who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?
2259612_1;negative;fuck u
2263196_1;negative;Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise.
2264018_2;negative;That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.
2268304_1;negative;This sucks badly.
2268304_2;negative;Why on earth does createLink() need a request?
2350557_2;negative;Finally closing this bug from hell.
238731_3;negative;I sure as hell don't want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards.
2470534_1;negative;That sucks why isn't the escape mechanism working?
286246_5;neutral;That is really confusing.
291420_1;negative;Sun RI sucks why the hell is saveState() and restoreState() not called with with javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD = server???

350972_1;negative;As far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could/should do Thread.currentThread().setName(x) or whatever (and maybe restore after)
353052_1;negative;BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow). 
362807_1;negative;Hmm that sucks.
366961_1;negative;tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!
367179_1;negative;Oh man ... it's a fucking precendence problem. 
367677_1;negative;Ugh well that sucks.
367902_5;negative;I didn't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3.x to 4.x  :-(  That sucks and it'll make old code stick around longer.
369884_1;negative;bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.
371904_4;negative;This whole thing is very distressing to me.
371904_5;negative;I think we all know it just sucks.
373905_1;negative;though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you madeI don't think we would ever come to agreement anyway.

455767_4;negative;I think you made mistakes in ivy.xml.
496044_12;negative;This is where it gets confusing.
540214_1;negative;If I can give you one advice on this one I'd say this: fuck Derby use H2 instead as the default embedded database.
579540_3;negative;So I'm fine with your logic but given that I don't understand it please don't get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it.
653331_5;negative;The rest are *totally* unrelated.
653758_1;negative;Oh fuck :-) Sorry. Not my day more beer needed!
654180_1;negative;"Sorry I guess I'm against ""never computing this shit""... because you guys think returning NaN is ok. "
654180_4;negative; if you want to make these optimizations fix the APIs so its intuitive otherwise no way.
654182_1;negative;who the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class. 
654611_1;negative;I don't care about code duplication here.
658580_1;negative;I disagree... and I guess I'm willing to go to bat for this.
660380_1;negative;HOLY SHIT!
663657_2;negative; I think the comments here are a bad sign... I sent us down an unfortunate slippery slope  we are a search engine library!  don't put shit in the index directory! or we will delete your shit. dead simple.
681152_1;negative;I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell.
681152_2;negative;Not only it's the first one in my life I'm seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors.
684394_2;negative;Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion.
684394_4;negative;I'm against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so.
729706_1;negative;My bad.
781197_1;negative;Igor is an idiot and we *do* need gmake.

890057_1;negative;PreCommit-HDFS-Build is stuck.
940145_6;negative;So it is stuck somewhere.
973402_1;negative;But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
987223_1;negative;@Matt... I'm an idiot I used the wrong patch. Sigh.
1796476_2;negative;I'm however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me.

1289367_18;neutral;[rvollmar 3/27/07] There are two bugs that are causing backwards compatibility issues and I think the emails we've been exchanging have confused them.
1326110_2;neutral;First an attempt is made to convert       * each argument.
132669_3;neutral;It is better to express such things in Java or in a query language that is designed for that.
132669_5;neutral;"In addition in the longterm we will all most likely be using annotations and the ""fetch group"" notion does *not* work with annotations."
1328594_8;neutral;It's generally pretty straightforward but extensibility is not quite clear.
1342186_2;neutral;I have changed one test to see what will happend if I set the pwdIdle to b > 0 and the test passes.
1342186_3;neutral;What exactly is your configuration ?
1342658_4;neutral;Also we have some problem during replication just when we try to replicate some deletion and it might prefectly explain why we get those issues.
1345883_3;neutral;(Ok as expected ...)  Waiting for a better log when you will have installed a new server build from 1.0-trunks then.
1346179_3;neutral;The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value which contains escaped values.
1346179_4;neutral;Here we have two options : 1) work with the internal value but escape all the special chars 2) work with the stored UP value.
1346179_5;neutral;I think the bnest solution is (2) because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.
1346179_6;neutral;This will impact two parts : - searchResultEntry - all the response that contains a LdapResult and which returns a MatchedDN.
1346179_7;neutral;I already have a fix for the first request but the question is : which version will integrate this modification ?
1346179_8;neutral;any suggestion ?
1351574_3;neutral;Then you might switch filter chains to ?
137361_1;positive;Thanks!
137361_3;neutral;We need a proper JUnit test for this!
1398734_1;neutral;Thanks for reviewing the patch Mamta!
1398734_2;neutral;I've been trying to test a patched build with ibm 1.5. on iseries but have run into trouble: - OOM with suites.All.

1398734_4;neutral;A second run (with 2048M) only got worse (sooner) OOM behavior and after that I had trouble getting rid of my processes - apparent hang with derbyall:lang/wisconsin.java.
1398734_6;neutral;On rerun I let it go for 20 mins but apart from the database getting booted (derby.log) nothing at all showed up in any of the output files (i.e.
1398734_8;neutral;During the 10.5.1.1 test cycle this test took about 5 mins (and passed).
1399944_7;neutral;I think I prefer this approach.
1411398_1;neutral;I remember that rule for line breaking in Japanese was very different from that of English.
1411398_2;neutral;In English sentence there exists space between words and that space tells where the line can be breaked.
1411398_3;neutral;However Japanese sentence does not have such a useful space between words.

1423346_2;negative;I too am concerned about the  DRDA 255 byte character string limit.

1459591_2;neutral;I'll open one now so I don't forget.

1539694_6;positive;I think SSTableDeletingTask is a good spot I just wasn't sure if that would be appropriate.
1541857_1;neutral;Why is it unsafe to share filter in SelectStatement for NQF?
1550511_2;neutral;Looks like you need to report this to the high-scale-lib project.
1564457_1;positive;Nice try :-)  I was Mr I dont believe in magic from the very beginning.
1564457_2;neutral;I thought that there are some common cases like tail and head caching or exclusion of columns that could be implemented.
1564457_3;neutral;But never mind - maybe the proposed cache is all greatness.
1564457_5;neutral;So to prevent a rude awakening for some users it might be cool to provide some means (config or whatever) that works similar as the current version.
1564457_6;neutral;Or at least schedule this for a release which allows for a downgrade.
1567293_3;neutral;Gotta show off the shinies first of course.

1628616_1;neutral;The Calculator sample now works with SimpleAxisServer.
1660328_9;positive;Are we on the good path...
1710387_1;positive;hi Dan!!
1718151_1;positive;Wow sure!
1729265_5;neutral;This practice in general seems really confusing to me this bug is refed in the 1.5.0 release notes tagged in svn. 
1778787_1;neutral;Well I'm not sure what was happening but I just upgraded to Spring 1.2 final and this issue does not happen anymore.
1778787_3;neutral;It really *did* happen in an earlier version though....
1787887_1;neutral;I disagree.
1787887_2;neutral;The manual should provide sufficient insight into the important use cases.
1787887_3;neutral;People tend to review javadoc when things don't go as expected or are unclear.
1787887_5;neutral;etc.
1787887_7;neutral;I reviewed javadoc but right or wrong I didn't come across this.
1787887_8;neutral;Google was also strangely quiet.
1800179_1;neutral;stupid autoresize option doesn't resize it correctly
1805685_3;neutral;) - it should be in AJDT in a couple of days.
1817942_1;neutral;I am sufficiently archaic as to have only a pre-ANSI-C K&R.
1817942_2;neutral;You can put *expressions* separated by commas in a for even back then:    for (i=1 j=100 i<j i++ j--)  But I guess that the tweak to allow *declarations* there only has one.
1825414_1;neutral;I was surprised to see this issue still getting so much commentary.
1825414_2;neutral;"I'm going to jump back to Robert's initial pushback here:  ""1."
1825414_3;neutral;Using technical tricks like automatically appending parameters to create unique JobInstance makes alarm bell ring - we should not be trying to do clever arbitrary things in classes that form the foundation of the framework.
1825414_4;neutral;If job instance has a lifecycle that ends with first successful execution we should refuse to start the same job instance ever after.
1825414_6;neutral;We described before that there are times that operators for whatever reason what's to restart a job with the same instance.
1825414_8;neutral;So it's like getting a new copy.
184201_7;neutral;My bad.
187748_25;negative;My  apologies for the confusion.
190531_1;neutral;Same goes for fontSize and fontWeight and other font styles.
192370_6;neutral;But on the other hand I also think if the processor has to do this initialization activity (i.e.
195182_1;neutral;Yeah it helps though I was more questioning whether there's not already a boolean that keeps track of this but apparently not.
1990074_2;neutral;Seems a bit restrictive to me that using rich:comboBox with s:convertEntity only displays entity IDs in the combo.
1990074_3;neutral;rich:comboBox is not a select component by nature - so what is it then if it's not used for selecting stuff?
2014921_1;neutral;Guys this defect is 5 years old now.
2024396_2;neutral;If it's a regression please open a new ticket.
2059085_1;neutral;Yeah I didn't mean to imply that setting a null value was the problem which is why I changed my comment to denote the problem was actually in the federated connector.
2059085_2;neutral;It appears to be a simple cast to the wrong type (from a copy/paste error during coding).
2096621_3;neutral;The instructions are fine.
2096621_4;neutral;Not sure how I got that all wrong.
2096621_5;negative;Sorry again.
2127189_3;neutral;Note to self: Always check for platform-dependent behavior!
2127189_4;neutral;I've tested with Ruby 1.8 Ruby 1.9 JRuby and even Rubinius but all on Linux.
2132048_2;neutral;Someone either needs to write a custom XSD and link it to the document or we need to disable validation for those examples pending another solution.
2148299_1;neutral;This request is unclear.
2148299_3;neutral;Why are you asking us for samples?
2153268_3;negative;Crossing fingers...
2162609_2;positive;Looking forward to your patch.
2181040_10;neutral;Nobody is able to tell what will happen here if something does not work.
2181040_13;neutral;And even if it would be who makes sure that the context loader at the time the shell was created is the same as the context loader at the time the shell is used?
2181040_14;neutral;Can we even be sure that the thread is the same?
2181040_16;neutral;If a threaded management is needed then a new class should be used that ensures the conditions are fulfilled.... that is at last that the context loader is unchanged.
2181040_17;neutral;I know in your webapp this condition might be fulfilled but GroovyShell is not special to web applications.  
2181040_3;neutral;Because of that the default parent is the same loader as the loader that loaded the class GroovyShell - this loader knows the groovy classes.
2181040_4;neutral;Setting the context class loader would require a test if the context loader knows Groovy classes and if this class is the same as the expected loader... what do we do if that is not the case?
2263196_2;neutral;Maybe first see the results of the discussion at: http://www.nabble.com/Undocumenten-constraints---consistency-of-templates-td21863067.html
2264018_1;positive;Thanks for the info David.
2350557_1;neutral;Woo hoo!
2418584_6;neutral;In other words using the setGenerateImportedSchemas() setter or not obviously makes a difference and given the fact that your main XML schema imports/includes the other one I'd suggest that you change your code generation strategy.
2418584_7;neutral;That's basically all I am saying.
247770_1;neutral;I know this is a closed issue but here goes anyway.
291420_2;neutral;Is this according to the spec?
291420_3;neutral;Do I miss something there?
305928_1;neutral;This is a really cool idea but I don't think this is going to make it into TRUNK before the 0.4 branch gets cut.
307884_1;negative;Forgot ASF grant.
319373_1;neutral;Duplicated here TAP5-1017
327900_1;negative;I'm sorry for making it confusing.
351191_2;neutral;SOLR-5232: SolrCloud should distribute updates via streaming rather than buffering.
362807_2;neutral;Maybe instead of overlays try configuring maven-war-plugin {{<packagingExcludes>}}: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/skinny-wars.html
367902_1;neutral;Erick   First of all anyone upgrading should examine CHANGES.txt which would certainly have a note on this explicitly in the upgrading section of that document.
367902_2;neutral;Secondly most point-release upgrades people do are ones in which the config stays the same.
367902_3;neutral;Thirdly the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their 3.5 schema would only error if that person ALSO chose to omit the defaultSearchField declaration -- but why would they do that?
367902_6;neutral;If that's true it'd be nice if we had a standard way to annotate such code so we can methodically remove the old stuff.
367902_7;neutral;@deprecated isn't enough because it's just at the method/class level not an internal if branch.
371904_10;neutral;This has been the history of Lucene and the thing about the project that I admired most - heavy hands where checked at the door.
371904_11;neutral;I'm no angel and I'm not perfect about this myself.
371904_2;positive;That is useful advice (call me biased if you'd like).
371904_3;negative;Honestly there is no way around this issue - of course we must discuss and come to some solution regarding Lucene/Solr at this point.
371904_7;neutral;My personal beef in this issue is not with that though - I simply am very offended by heavy handed reverts and such.
371904_8;neutral;I feel the same way about JIRA.

571429_4;neutral;It's a feature which seems to be enabled by default.

571429_9;neutral;@3.
579540_2;neutral;That's why I need to ask questions now when I want to understand the current logic (as it is not logical for me).
579540_5;neutral;"the logical solution to me was to add the methods to the interface) so I guess I did the right thing opening this bug and asking for your opinion and I can't accept your ""for the sake of sweet Jesus"" in reply."

643910_1;neutral;{quote} viewColumn v.s.
643910_5;neutral;{quote}  Neither of these produce a copy.
655910_14;neutral;it's not a merge setting and I think it's rather confusing today since we take the merge setting and use it for indexing.
663103_4;neutral;Thats why I think its good to keep them (of course as short and minimal as possible).
670169_6;neutral;I think if you use either LogDoc/ByteSizeMergePolicy forceMerge also does what it says.
673988_4;positive;It's great to see you've gotten the ball rolling Chris.
680798_23;neutral;{quote}  I fail to see why that is a bad thing if we're looking at the rare scenario of having to postpone the sorting decision to search time.
681152_3;neutral;If we're so bent on backcompat I suggest deprecating one of these methods now and removing it in next major release.
684394_3;neutral;Easy to say we can come back to this easy not to.
691763_2;neutral;ConstantScoreQuery and FilterQuery need to AND the filters   together.

740211_1;neutral;How should integer division work for decimals and floating point?

746297_20;neutral;I will make the change.
784385_13;neutral;I think I would be happy with a process where a weinre build is kicked off for every commit to master.
799225_1;neutral;"Okay ""unfortunately"" nothing  abnormal there."
807596_1;positive;Hi John  I would agree using object notification is probably a cleaner way to do this.
850349_9;neutral;Otherwise the constant will be converted   to DOUBLE.
890867_3;neutral;Contributed by Ashish Singhi.
900441_1;neutral;It will be taken care as part of HADOOP-7642.
921721_4;neutral;I think the rename should follow the same pattern.
954089_6;neutral;If so make the formatting same as it is for rest of codebase on commit?
957374_1;negative;Which API at the thrift client you are referring?
977944_2;neutral;Neither is the rest of this.
980254_1;neutral;I'll make an updated patch.
987792_3;neutral;I think this is what caught me the first time I tried this
988452_2;neutral;I'm going to close this out.
711843_2;neutral; Under copyright law there are several potential kinds of damages one can obtain for infringement.  
711843_3;neutral;The only forms of damage that make practical litigation sense in the FOSS world are *statutory damages* and *attorney's fees*. 
711843_4;neutral;To obtain those kinds of damages a copyright notice is required. 
711843_5;neutral;(There are other requirements for these types of damages also all described in 17 USC 401 et seq.) OTOH if you want to waste your time proving *actual infringement damages* for free software don't bother with a notice but also don't bother trying to find an attorney to argue your case.

810726_1;neutral;OK.
1216174_1;neutral;It is ok for goog.requires to be missing.
1216174_3;neutral;It is not ok for the interface reference not be fully qualified.
675571_1;neutral;OK done added some more javadocs as well.
681403_5;neutral;) then I'm ok with that as well.
253901_1;neutral;Ok.
754664_1;neutral;OK to commit to 1.4.4
1468545_4;neutral;I just hope it does wait forever on sockets or anything stupid like that...  but we'll see.
165429_10;neutral;Unrelated should the PBImpls be moved from yarn-api to yarn-common (They're private anyway).
165429_31;neutral;Unrelated should ApplcaitionTokenIdentifer be renamed to something like AMTokenIdentifier ?
914301_3;neutral;This also seems pretty reproducible.
1412206_5;neutral;if (!jj_semLA || jj_3R_60()) return true     if (jj_3R_61()) return true     return false   }  The simple fix could be to wrap the lookingAhead assignment  after the call within finally block.

1379910_17;neutral;If that's not true then you can pretty much ignore everything in this particular comment...
1124113_2;neutral;It just depends upon how smart the plug in framework and the actual plug in is.
1171690_5;neutral;Plus of course you don't have to hardcode the name of the jarfile.
1148330_21;neutral;Currently we just assume it might be a laggard and thus isSlowTracker() will return true.

647874_1;neutral;Pretty fancy.
629125_2;neutral;Though it is still a possibility it is pretty corner-case.
1734902_1;neutral;I think there were a mistake.
1013237_40;neutral;Of course this is debatable.
1393183_2;neutral;Of course I have en_US for my locale.

376487_1;neutral;Definitely true!

563727_3;neutral;I will take this into account of course.
642690_1;neutral;Ah of course.
1138883_2;neutral;Must have been confused.
797050_1;neutral;Of course I meant 2.1.8 beta not 2.1.8 dev.
1188068_7;neutral;This seems backward to me (but of course I'm no expert in this area).
812311_2;neutral;Specially the framework.
1079285_3;neutral;This may fit for Pregel but not for our Framework since our communication is much more expensive.
1043215_2;neutral;Patch is pretty trivial but gives +15% on MT/SerialBench on 2-core Core2.
948627_2;neutral;Please re-open if I'm confused.
901480_2;neutral;You mixing fd and HostComparator confused me.
291117_1;neutral;Of course there is no NotNullException.
582041_2;neutral;of course it could be built on the fly...
697378_2;neutral;Of course this only applies if someone where to finish 831 and it where accepted...
736235_23;neutral;After a while that .api package will get pretty crowded too.
923019_2;neutral;I will post a new patch pretty soon.
526030_1;neutral;Framework translations in rev 701679. 
806565_1;neutral;How about a slightly different take?
797855_2;neutral;Damn copy/paste programming.
884638_2;neutral;If so that's a pretty bad admin experience.
1180608_9;neutral;It seems pretty reliable.
1064886_7;neutral;The framework is incomplete without it.
344362_1;neutral;In revision 1064741 the framework is functional and activated for the enhancer.
1027863_2;neutral;Is there a way to stop the hbase with the regionserver dead?
142826_1;neutral;If I am not wrong the follower that is stuck never accepts the leadership of the Leader in the ensemble because it is an established ensemble and it sees no quorum in it.
934190_2;neutral;The 0.95 branch is dead and defunct.
1629813_2;neutral;But I didn't get any memory errors.
1110621_4;neutral;It was confusing for me too.
371565_1;neutral;Hmmm... confusing.
525362_4;neutral;Doing things based on an organizationPartyId associated with the user is BAD BAD BAD and basically kills the multi-organization support in OFBiz.

906649_3;neutral;Move startTime from DecommingStatus to DatanodeDescriptor so startTime could be used to represent either decommissioning or dead start time 2.
1583673_2;neutral;once this error occurs the route cannot be used any more.
725456_3;neutral;However controller passing live brokers minus shutting down brokers as live leaders in the LeaderAndIsrRequest sounds like a premature optimization and a bug.

989452_1;neutral;bq.In order to maintain different states at which we are in while creating table should we go for a special node under the table znode or can we add new states to the existing table states like (DISABLING ENABLING DISABLED etc) IMO go with separate node.

660357_16;neutral;I don't quite see why the attached implementation would do more heap operations but I agree that it could be slower due to lengthier/more complex loops a few more if statements etc.
306574_2;neutral;So what this patch does is totally revamps the makefiles for erlang.
177189_6;neutral;The times will be grep'ed and used for inspection in Excel.
513172_7;neutral;Unfortunately the xml parser in use is event based in the wrong direction(push instead of pull) so the bulk of the change is flipping that around.

1465721_1;neutral;If you are stuck with solr 4.0 alpha here's a patch which may work. 
622818_2;neutral;This patch also adds the new resource emulation framework to GridMix.
1177358_1;neutral;We need verify all the links and buttons in console to ensure the fix.
1675227_3;neutral;avro-mapred -- we might end up with avro-mapreduce as well for the newer api so I stuck with the package name of the hadoop api. 
403321_1;neutral;Sounds reasonable.
1158760_1;neutral;This sounds reasonable to me.
809661_7;neutral;Content-wise the only part that stuck out to me was the inclusion of the many exceptions that users  will never see.
146057_1;neutral;Sounds reasonable to me given it's a standalone (debug) utility.
390184_4;neutral;It is a little weird since the multi-core aspect would only be usable programatically but that will make it possible to easily bat around a 'core manager' and http design.
992380_17;neutral;Can't be avoided though given what is going on here.       
1712919_2;neutral;Pretty much the same stack trace.
1609739_3;neutral;I don't want to pull the whole patch though.
742814_3;neutral;Moreover there must be something going wrong in relation to the SPO index an exception is thrown:  ERROR **** Not the root: 11264 com.hp.hpl.jena.tdb.index.bplustree.BPTreeException 
689231_3;neutral;Back-compat Lucene-style and agile design aren't something that marries well.
216813_1;neutral;We are currently stuck with this issue?
1159035_2;neutral;Specifically the existing framework only lets us plug-in custom compress/decompress 'streams' (e.g.
239226_4;neutral;If you really don't want such a link you could always hide it with CSS.  
1559316_5;neutral;DROP INDEX <INDEX_NAME>  making this the only option right now would suck because we don't auto-generate an index name when none is provided.
1507231_3;neutral;There are just too many checks there that Click is not using and we can't just use them all (many don't make sense to Click at all) :).
604249_1;neutral;I'm not against fixing the CS I just want to ensure we do the 'right' fix.
399155_2;neutral;That's why I'm going to use easymock as SMSC simulator.
1538306_1;neutral;This was fixed Cassandra-side for 2.0 in CASSANDRA-5702 but the fix was pretty heavyweight and backporting to 1.2.x is not an option.
784662_1;neutral;#NAME?
710558_1;neutral;Please use git diff to generate patch because I can't easily apply git patch on a svn tree.
159912_10;neutral;Does that sound like a reasonable plan going forward?
145396_1;neutral;I won't intrude on the design discussion sounds good.
213838_1;neutral;Fixed using the new injection framework and xwork configuration design.
997564_11;neutral;Otherwise we would be storing the bytes-per-checksum field but not actually using it which would be really confusing.
707693_3;neutral;if it gets started at all.
1032208_3;neutral;J-D gave my patch a review and said fine except for some line-lengths which I've fixed.
706069_17;neutral;To be quite blunt guys your log4net logger methods smell bad.
940420_3;neutral;We've been passing builds pretty regular now so if this a problem it should start showing prominently.
1118772_2;neutral;You just need to remember to put the expected first in the assertion or it gets confusing
171715_15;neutral;That can't be expressed with a static suffix but it's easily expressed with a regex.
689231_13;neutral;I'm not sure this can't be achieved without messing with IR/W guts so much.
185903_2;neutral;2.8.0 is no longer supported so even if there is a bug it won't be fixed in 2.x.y release series.
850737_9;neutral;In TestCliDriver create_view.q and udaf_percentile_approx.q are two weird queries.
1469318_2;neutral;By passing in the section name {{null}} the content of the global section can be retrieved.
532018_1;neutral;Submit a patch and I'll play with it.
1461896_2;neutral;But I'd have to play with it some to see for certain.
180534_8;neutral;"This is to say that we've a pretty good coverage of IDC ""keyref"" use cases."
1339064_2;neutral;After moving it to a local disk I can't reproduce it anymore.
316006_1;neutral;I just realized I never really explained the original problem that led me to making these fixes.
1498336_3;neutral;So this is by design.
1557075_2;neutral;We can borrow some design techniques etc.
1500121_1;neutral;Marcus that sounds sensible.

1539509_1;neutral;Is there a way to fetch a pull request?
1467086_2;neutral;Please pull it up to the release branch.Thank you!
956141_12;neutral;Will pull that into the 2.0.4-alpha branch.
694225_3;neutral;Maybe something silly is going one.
1610758_3;neutral;For the first part I got stuck on two points.
290420_3;neutral;You really shouldn't call one without the other.
501425_32;neutral;Every framework will benefit from that!
500953_21;neutral;* Framework for JMS db access can be reused.
1328868_2;neutral;:org.osgi.compendium-1.0.1artifact and felix-1.0.4 framework
1565828_1;neutral;CFS.gRS is a pretty thin layer over RowIterator.
526352_1;neutral;this pretty much explains the three imports. 
795902_2;neutral;Jerermy is the sole subscriber/moderator and can take care of adding other subs.
502566_2;neutral;Are you planning on doing this (or already have done this) or would you like me to do it?  
915373_1;neutral;Doug you defined: +public interface NamenodeProtocols +  extends ClientProtocol +          DatanodeProtocol +          NamenodeProtocol +          RefreshAuthorizationPolicyProtocol +          RefreshUserToGroupMappingsProtocol { ...}  Will this prevent us from putting the DatanodeProtocol in a different port?
871077_2;neutral;But would there be other cases that the writer stuck for different reasons?
788835_2;neutral;There is a single directory ~apbackup/remotelybackedup and anything symlinked to there gets backed up as documented in the README.
1545644_1;neutral;Jeremy are you still planning to take a stab at this?
519215_2;neutral;Nothing gets broken but we have one more step towards framework independence.
673410_7;neutral;We won't find the same group in a different segment.
684599_2;neutral;Will commit in a few days (to the heavy committing branch) if no one objects. 
351186_1;neutral;This patch takes care of the nocommits in the previous patch.
711989_1;neutral;is anybody taking care of this?
654312_7;neutral;There's a TODO which I'll take care of before merging to 4x (there are other renames too).
1140998_6;neutral;That would take care of most cases.
1161182_8;neutral;However if the implementation of next is not capable of handling bad records then it is most likely going to throw an exception and the proposal in this jira for handling bad input starts with that assumption.
1471181_6;neutral;I imagine that if 7-Zip can do this decryption then the encryption mechanism I seek is not forbidden by licensing restrictions.
742953_4;neutral;Also I won't give you a patch next time but just the whole new TestTransSystem.
575032_5;neutral;That said I had to do something similar in configurators and I did this by adding wrappers to the getInitParameter.
489830_2;neutral;Therefore it can no longer be used.
908451_2;neutral;We have different disk sizes on our DNs.
524892_2;neutral;I don't have a problem with a non-component directory in the framework.
1521395_3;neutral;I do have a patch but unfortunately I am not a position to sign the CLA.
1741987_3;neutral;The same exception happens the I forget to sign my jars.
315467_2;neutral;The squeeky wheel gets oiled!
1436378_5;neutral;This is where the bus gets over lapped.
1330294_1;neutral;OK  The problem is that the o.a.f.bundlerepository doesn't cares about R3 or R4 bundles.
369308_30;neutral;Somehow I forget to move that from SOLR-2524 but it is in the updated patch now.
729780_3;neutral;I am planning on doing a round-robin assignment for each partition.
1560275_1;neutral;all the key and column name comparisons should be case insensitive (and we force keyAlias to be ascii so you don't need to worry about it being some weird bytes stuff).
1461735_1;neutral;@Paul  Forget the previous patch it added unneeded complexity for parsing and dealing with multivalue (line) ini file  config parameters.

1128998_3;neutral;Adding directories to removedStorageDirs in original patch is already in branch-1.
581420_1;neutral;The source of this problem is master and slave allowing frameworks to register with IDs already used by completed frameworks.
1497284_1;neutral;This is introduced by API performance refactoring the intent is to generate the same response object for both listxxx api and other apis related to the same entity.
1435679_3;neutral;There may perhaps be some way to use Windows file-locking as a signalling mechanism here.
1667843_12;neutral;Alternatively we could build a variation avro-ipc.jar that shades in avro.jar that could be the smallest unit for OSGi.
970138_1;neutral;Actually let's just fix the issue you discovered here.
1429231_1;neutral;we don't have an agreement that it should be active
1397856_4;neutral;Also I looked at first corrupted database that I posted  and found the corruption in the  index TEST1_IDX_INDCOL2.
1557000_6;neutral;I could not find any documented limits but if I missed them somewhere I will gladly put them in.
1468837_3;neutral;However I doubt that the same is true for MapContext because it is just a wrapper around a HashMap.
1137601_2;neutral;"There is no RPC stuck but a lot of ""Connection reset by peer""."
1551755_4;neutral;With hampered performance of sstableloader after 1.0 its made the things very difficult for us.
1475280_2;neutral;I fixed some bad markup in r1392857 but I can see the error afterwards on the neko stuff.
1548932_1;neutral;The thing about backwards-compatibility hacks is you tend to get stuck with them.
546994_1;neutral;This is part of making Oak OSGi-friendly
384126_10;neutral;However I'm not a lawyer.
1007833_2;neutral;It seems to be adding new 'functionality' to coprocessors.
960749_4;neutral;Adding sleeps solves it.
1540325_1;neutral;We're adding endpoint as a new datatype?

1044677_5;neutral;Also I'm slightly confused by your description because in section 5.8 of the spec it says that members of code_handler_class_RCN can be null.
207435_6;neutral;Since I screwed up the commit we voted 2.1.7 down and are working to get 2.1.8 out pretty quickly.
1003849_2;neutral;A user looking at the set of changes won't care :)

646876_5;neutral;and at the moment we dont have that yet.
581894_1;neutral;[~bmahler] it looks like this can be closed since the Python UI is gone.
581894_2;neutral;Is that true?
1954699_1;neutral;seems this is a CDK issue
2389859_2;neutral;I am transfering my issues so I want to know the current status.
2099735_1;neutral;Thanks for reporting.
2099735_2;neutral;Fixed on the master (0d43528e) and the 1.6 (9affb57a).
1007616_2;neutral;or someother version?
1014746_1;neutral;ThriftServer.java and Hbase.thrift patched manually the other files generated using thrift-0.2.0

470394_2;neutral;Thanks Ankit!
1358709_4;neutral;I tripped across one puzzling sentence but it wasn't something that you changed: In the second longer paragraph of the BUILTIN bullet we recommend LDAP and user-supplied schemes as alternatives to BUILTIN but we don't recommend NATIVE.
1358709_5;neutral;Did we decide to not recommend NATIVE here or should this be adjusted to include it beside the other safe schemes?
1358709_6;neutral;Thanks.
1589002_1;neutral;See attached patch.
1589002_2;neutral;I'll add docs in Confluence if the example is integrated in Camel's codebase.

2369355_1;neutral;Moved to GA.
2449525_1;neutral;This appears to be a issue with Hibernate (the default JPA implementation in JBoss AS) rather than a EJB3 issue.

428835_1;positive;Cool - good information to have.  Thanks Lance!
2110584_1;neutral;I integrated the submitted patch in the new JBW but did not really test it.
2110584_2;neutral;Nobody has complained about it yet but I don't think it should be ported to older versions at this time.

857455_2;neutral;This will reduce object creation.
857455_3;neutral;The patch needs to be regenerated against the current trunk but otherwise looks good.
580447_1;positive;cool stuff! a good candidate to put on myfaces-commons-utils so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp faces-config.
1358696_1;neutral;Thanks Kristian.

2087167_1;neutral;Deleted spurious 'Added: svn:executable' from the patch.

1982039_1;neutral;I suggest making a tooltip with the title of the context help article (a popup)  when the user hovers the question mark icon.
1920925_1;neutral;We'll go with this for now thanks for the fix!
912375_1;neutral;Ran some benchmarks.

2354572_1;positive;Hey you're right that idea was probably not the best approach to the problem - 0.6 looks really nice looking forward to it :)
1776805_1;neutral;Indeed!
1776805_2;neutral;This is actually the case in 2.0.5 already.
1776805_3;neutral;Thanks for spotting this Philipp!
907912_1;neutral;It seems that using {{BufferedOutputStream}} is a better solution since it will also help other operations.
907912_2;neutral;BTW do you know why there are four one-byte packets?
1549909_1;neutral;Dupe of CASSANDRA-4042 (we'll include the BF fp change there)

1002038_1;neutral;Closing as fixed in trunk.
1712997_1;neutral;We have an HTTP discovery agent in activemq-http no other activity on this issue so closing for now.

2402199_1;positive;This is a great suggestion.
623487_1;neutral;Thanks Amar!
1573728_1;neutral;Would your use case be covered by adding a TTL to CF?
1573728_2;neutral;Because that seems like the natural level of granularity for this to me.

402189_2;neutral;are enough for this rather than full blown regexp.
402189_3;neutral;It's also easier then to tell a wildcard-based config from a normal one.

449674_1;neutral;I know this hasn't been looked at in quite a while.
449674_2;neutral;I can't see the current GOP and GKOP being completely replaced but there may well be some areas where your code could be incorporated.
449674_3;neutral;It would help considerably if you could explain what the problem was/is with finite sized pools and the current implementation.
449674_4;neutral;Without an explanation of what the issue is this issue is likely to remain dormant or just be closed as won't fix.
2248369_1;neutral;Done as part of Felix resolver integration

2276054_1;neutral;Thanks for Paul King's advice I tried 1.6.3 again with groovy.bat.

205810_1;positive;Thanks for reporting solved!
1945698_2;neutral;Thanks!
1465991_1;neutral;I will rewrite that part.
2134187_1;neutral;Scratch that this fails horribly after the change to unparsing negative numbers as hex.

693792_2;neutral;I'll commit soon.
1210099_1;neutral;Patch committed.
580709_1;positive;Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp  There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)
1210099_2;neutral;Thanks Hari!
741066_3;neutral;It looks like there is an unencodable character.
2547124_1;neutral;JMX support will be implemented with the remoting project.
2269259_1;neutral;As of the new log4j DSL this is not an issue

717914_1;neutral;Fixed for exclusion: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1539249
288955_1;neutral;Hi  Thanks for your help testing this stuff.
288955_2;neutral;I did a review and I found the problem is not on tomahawk.
288955_3;neutral;Really it is a side effect of the browser (IE 7 and IE 8).
288955_6;neutral;I'll close this issue as won't fix but anyway I commit the fix on tomahawk examples.
310347_1;neutral;89 and 90 look fine.
376257_1;positive;Cool feature!  Performance:  - It looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again (eval) for every update request.
2116246_1;neutral;Yes this was fixed through Yecht.
2375072_1;neutral;Should be fixed with DOXIA-390 I added your test case.

1447417_1;neutral;patch reviewed and applied by Eoghan with r502283
260556_2;positive;Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly-named operations.
260556_3;neutral;I wonder if there are any advantages to your way of doing it over mine but I think yours will definitely work to detect the error cases I had in mine.  
1556724_1;neutral;Fair enough.
705725_1;neutral;Hello Bhumir  I think Ivan is right - can you try to test your case with the complete version of log4php not only the files I have mentioned.
705725_2;neutral;Thanks for you patience - this is a nasty issue.
705725_3;neutral;Cheers Christian

1936386_1;neutral;[~lfryc] [~bleathem] [~ppitonak] Do you think guys that those page fragments methods which depend on JSON parsing - aka various {{setupFromWidget}} should throw {{UnsupportedOperationException}} till this issue is resolved ?
1936386_2;neutral;IMHO not as we can quite quickly implement this right ?
803094_2;neutral;thanks asankha
2385607_1;neutral;Yeah this was a word which somebody had looked up in Dacco.
2385607_2;neutral;I saw 'acusament de recepci?' in the GDLC but I wasn't certain what it was in English.
2385607_3;neutral;Perhaps 'acknowledgement slip' would be the most commonly used term in English?
1434805_1;neutral;Applied the same fix as in issue 25001  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-commons/dbcp/src/java/org/apache/commons/dbcp/datasources/PerUserPoolDataSource.java?r1=1.10&r2=1.11&diff_format=h

2127485_1;neutral;Resolved in commit 5260 (patch by Vladimir Sizikov)
1615699_1;neutral;Patch submitted.
1615699_3;neutral;Thank you.
1618006_1;neutral;I filed bug # 42715 with ASF Bugzilla about the ant.version issue.
426446_1;neutral;Seems fine to me.
578535_1;neutral;Thanks for looking after this.
980981_2;neutral;Added as a subtask [HBASE-6157] to this parent jira.
980981_3;neutral;Hope that should be fine.
478251_1;neutral;I added the PDType1CFont patch in revision 1425301
485706_1;neutral;Since we will have another RC we decided to include this change in 1.5.2.
1883953_1;neutral;Documentation is still a bit lacking
1799586_1;neutral;Don't absue the ticketing system
668048_1;neutral;I committed {{BasicFunctionalityTest.testHTMLStrip()}} to branch_3x - it succeeds for me with no changes required.
2165641_1;neutral;The per invocation timeout facility has been added for the rmi and sslrmi transports.
2540286_2;neutral;Indeed this saved some time.
887367_1;neutral;Looks like this was fixed in HDFS-3966 (For branch-1 TestFileCreation should use JUnit4 to make assumeTrue work).
2131161_1;neutral;I'm kinda dissapointed.

1607244_2;neutral;+1 thanks Ivan.
456364_3;neutral;I don't see the issue on trunk.
456364_4;neutral;Just realize that.
456364_5;neutral;Thanks!
456364_7;neutral;I should have tested with trunk before creating this jira.
456364_8;neutral;I think I even tried with pig-0.11 to confirm the problem.
1678217_1;neutral;I'm sorry for the confusion.
2036173_1;neutral;Thanks Ittay.
2036173_3;neutral;Under what runtime conditions are you seeing this.?
2036173_5;neutral;2
2036173_6;neutral;Would you have a test that we can use to reproduce?
1050624_2;positive;It's OK.

658099_2;neutral;I'll take a broader look tomorrow. 
527415_1;neutral;Jacques if you create separate issues for the erros (icluding the logs) I can take a look them.
527415_2;neutral;Thanks for your vote.

1191390_1;neutral;I think your logic is right.
1191390_3;neutral;1
1191390_4;neutral;FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.
1191390_6;neutral;FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.
1191390_7;neutral;3
1191390_8;neutral;In that case caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).
1191390_9;neutral;Logically this is also fine.
1191390_10;neutral;NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.
1191390_11;neutral;Caching is a specialized function.
1191390_12;neutral;So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.
1191390_14;neutral;So the action items: 1. canDelete() canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.  
1830169_1;neutral;Please review and close out if appropriate.
1043193_3;neutral;Thanks very much for the contribution.
1043193_4;neutral;The fixing is available in all builds after r658561.
587137_1;neutral;solved in subversion repository as of r818942.
942679_1;neutral;Thanks for the patch Gustavo.
942679_2;neutral;I applied to 0.95 and trunk.
1821302_1;neutral;I thought there was already a (Hibernate specific?)
1680193_2;neutral;Add the new file modules\java2wsdl\src\test\java\org\apache\tuscany\tools\java2wsdl\generate\ExampleService.java 2.
1680193_3;neutral;Apply the changes in patch1658 3.
1680193_4;neutral;Unzip ws-void-args-return under the itest directory 4.
1680193_5;neutral;Update the pom for itest to include ws-void-args-return  This patch fixes TUSCANY-1658 and TUSCANY-1653 and add an itest to verify the fix.
1659339_1;neutral;Applied patch.
1659339_2;neutral;Thanks!
854145_1;neutral;+1 looks good. 
1025268_2;neutral;Oh and that wiki page for the shell is slightly formatted wrong by the looks it changes to cursive/italics and stays until the end.
1025268_3;neutral;And the .irbrc sample output has no line breaks and makes it difficult to read it.
877499_2;neutral;Fix race conditions in Balancer.

2065257_1;neutral;Applied the patch to implement Workspace.move
234857_1;neutral;We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).
234857_3;neutral;And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is  I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.
1049100_1;neutral;Thanks Tatyana - the third patch was applied to BTI branch 2.0 at r552655.
1899200_1;neutral;Sebastian as Sonar calls the cobertura maven plugin there is not much we can do.
2146300_2;neutral;The Sun JSF-RI team have implemented a fix for this issue.
2146300_4;neutral;See the following link for more info:  https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=612  Thanks Ian
2323091_1;neutral;Patch applied on 2.1.x 2.2.x and trunk
385042_1;neutral;Just an update:  # SOLR-1131: aka poly fields is almost ready to go.
385042_2;neutral;Please review.
385042_3;neutral;# SOLR-1297: sort by function query just needs review and then can be committed.
385042_4;neutral;After that we can add in the Cartesian Tier indexing and the Cartesian Tier QParserPlugin (after a little re-write).
385042_5;neutral;Then we need pseudo-fields and we likely  want to hook in a per request function cache (maybe)
1423534_1;positive;Hi Suran  The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.
1423534_2;neutral;It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid.
1423534_3;neutral;I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now.
1423534_4;neutral;I will post my results when the tests finish.
1423534_6;neutral;In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.
1423534_7;neutral;"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID""."
1423534_8;neutral;o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class.
1423534_9;neutral;o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).
1423534_10;neutral;However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.
1423534_12;neutral;But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.
1423534_14;neutral;Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.
1423534_15;neutral;SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.
1423534_16;neutral;That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).
1423534_18;neutral;But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.
1423534_22;neutral;SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table.
1423534_23;neutral;DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.
1423534_26;neutral;Thanks -Rick 
425267_2;neutral;This one fixes the end-date issue in the comment bean classes: URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=782269&view=rev  And that resolves this issue in the trunk.
688399_1;neutral;Hey Chrisyou just moved the files right?!
21301_1;neutral;Also applies to the 4.x series
1946907_2;neutral;Attribute 'width' works fine.
1014458_2;neutral;Would be nice to have a batch/list functionality as well like we have for deletes/puts.
480162_1;neutral;It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.
480162_2;neutral;Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs.
1836207_1;neutral;In the same pc I have a outlook client and It work fine the problem is with xplanner how can I  configurate xplanner for send mails ?
1836207_2;neutral;Thanks
2516675_1;neutral;ok I'm looking into this.
280697_1;neutral;Okay reviewed and tested patch with sqlite3 and bdb on trunk.
280697_2;neutral;One minor correction to configure without sqlite3.
280697_4;neutral;#NAME?
2192201_1;neutral;Have a look at hibernate.common.xml
412291_1;neutral;Hi David  This helps me understand what you were talking about - thanks!
412291_2;neutral;(Things weren't as clear at 2am ))    Yes we should probably definitely be removing the ThreadLocal entirely.
412291_3;neutral;I'll make those changes as soon as I can.
412291_4;neutral;#NAME?
766227_1;neutral;Patch applied in trunk.
766227_3;neutral;Thank you for your contribution.
1114706_3;neutral;Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree) when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?
1114706_4;neutral;You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.
360149_1;neutral;Ah ok ... thanks for the heads up.
1427702_1;neutral;Changes to the test look good and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.
1427702_2;neutral;I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.
1673444_1;neutral;I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.
1673444_2;neutral;The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.
1673444_3;neutral;I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).
1673444_4;neutral;The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.
1673444_5;neutral;Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.
1673444_6;neutral;I've also started to add cascading configuration.
1673444_8;neutral;ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).
1673444_9;neutral;I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.
1673444_10;neutral;In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.
1673444_11;neutral;This allows for a two-phase rendering.
1673444_13;positive;:)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.
1673444_14;neutral;I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.
2130073_1;positive;Looks like this is fixed :)
766038_1;positive;Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.
1754304_1;positive;Sounds like a good idea.
1581490_2;neutral;For the CAMEL-3787 I think the key should be on the ftp client configure to find out right charset that the server is using.
804555_1;neutral;> MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE)   Use strict mode instead of browser compatibility.
1212896_2;neutral;Tests pass but there is some weirdness going on with rat failing on licenses because it tries to examine the surefire reports...
408618_1;neutral;Thanks for supplying the patch.
408618_4;neutral;Please close this bug if this is ok for you.
259521_1;neutral;I showed my interest on this idea in the dev-mailing list and currently started to explore the requirements and a design. 
2086495_2;neutral;Thanks
297441_1;neutral;OK will open the issue with Solr/Lucene.
297441_2;positive;Many thanks for your help.
1114268_2;neutral;Does this applies to 0.22 trunk or 0.23 trunk?
1767428_1;neutral;Thanks.
1767428_2;neutral;I found the note in the manual about @Resource and that fixes it.
1767428_3;neutral;At this point I'd suggest  peppering the docs with references to @Resource wherever it discusses autowiring things or about collections.
1767428_4;neutral;"E.g. ""note: if you're trying to auto wire a collection with annotations you'll need to use @Resource instead of @Autowired""."
258148_1;neutral;I looked at all the TODO's in uimaj-core and found only one Sofa-related exception that needed update.
258148_2;neutral;Fixed it's foot.
1605030_1;neutral;Patch applied.

1327335_1;neutral;The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior
747246_1;neutral;Could you please verify and/or adapt your patch against the current version at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/jcs/branches/generics-interface I was not able to apply your patch there.
1814664_1;neutral;A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.
1961214_1;neutral;Pull request available here:  https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-roo/pull/8  The changes are minor.
2452643_2;neutral;But it does not work when I try it using maven integration plugin for eclipse.
2452643_3;neutral;I have open a ticket on their side: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNGECLIPSE-1054 
2423462_1;neutral;I would rather not have specific vendor JDK names listed in there if can be avoided anyway.
2423462_2;neutral;Not sure when it was added.
2423462_3;neutral;worth investigating.
1083704_1;neutral;Committed to branch-2.1-beta branch-2 and trunk.
1069635_1;neutral;Verified patch applied as expected.
1412146_1;neutral;Dyre thanks for your comments.
1412146_4;neutral;I did a change to BULIDING.txt adding ${j14lib}/security.jar to java14compile.classpath in the description of how to build with IBM JDK.
1412146_5;neutral;I have not verified that it works and hope someone would confirm that it's correct.
533296_1;neutral;Jacopo  Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.
533296_2;neutral;David  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful especially for larger businesses.
533296_3;neutral;I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.
533296_4;neutral;The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.
533296_5;neutral;However I also run into the opposite problem.
1489050_1;neutral;This should have been fixed by commit 26a5b76ee6b77909a7b8d5b00924f12e1671373d.
1489050_2;neutral;Verified on my vmware setup extract volume is working fine now.
680599_2;neutral;Anyway for this file it's not really important I think - a very simple and tiny file w/ no history to preserve?
2094157_1;neutral;Please keep this open until reverse tests are configured as we might have new issues coming from them.
1453891_1;neutral;Ok got it thanks for the explanation.
1453891_2;neutral;In any case the code for the toBytes method is written now so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.
1453891_3;neutral;It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.
145320_1;neutral;An example patch.
145320_2;neutral;Was unable to run the unit test I wrote (because my setup is being a jerk) but I'm more looking for input on the design.
724751_1;neutral;Thanks for the reviews committed the patch to trunk
289945_2;neutral;I seem to be having trouble applying the patches though and I'd hate for all these corrections and improvements to be lost.
289945_4;neutral;That would really help a lot.
289945_5;positive;Thanks once again.
451707_1;neutral;It is good to know that pluto has a problem here but I realy need servlets integrated pluto.
1984725_1;neutral;@Arnaud: My key looks exactly the same and was generated with Cygwin's ss-keygen.
1984725_2;neutral;The file has Unix line endings though ...  @Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27).
677027_1;positive;bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great  Awesome! :)
2113606_2;neutral;One of the things I changed in jnr-posix was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.
2113606_3;neutral;Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime ctime mtime fields).
2113606_4;neutral;Otherwise the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end which are not part of the windows stat64 struct so will probably be filled with either zero or garbage.  
1540427_1;neutral;{quote}  Hmm looks like the backport blew away scrubtest on 1.2 as well.
1540427_4;neutral;Just for clarification skipBloomFilters is old.
1540427_5;neutral;#1 and #2 are incorrect.
456033_1;positive;Great! Awesome work Nick and thanks for the clarification Bill. 
1540427_7;neutral;2: In 2.0 the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable also the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing.
1186476_1;positive;Great work...this is awesome stuff. 
645538_1;neutral;I made a preliminary patch to share the idea how this can be fixed.
645538_6;neutral;Maybe because a JUnit doesn't really mimic a real hadoop env?
152270_1;positive;great. awesome job sergey!
412699_1;positive;Awesome - great stuff Maria.  Thanks!
645538_8;neutral;#NAME?
883339_1;positive;Thanks for doing that Uma.
883339_2;neutral;It looks like there is something about the build scripts that is causing it because hdfs.proto where NameSpaceInfoProto is defined is more or less identical between trunk and branch-2.
675234_1;positive;Wow!
1160849_1;neutral;I just committed this.
1160849_2;positive;Thanks Bryan!
915538_1;neutral;+1  Patch looks nice.
915538_2;neutral;Probably worth adding a third case in testDataDirectories for a URI that includes an authority (file://localhost/path).
1163773_1;positive;Patch looks good to me.
911559_2;neutral;I've committed this.
911559_4;neutral;Resolving as fixed.
914494_1;positive;It is good to have the test.
914494_2;neutral;I ran it on current trunk.
914494_3;neutral;It successfully gets the expected exception but then fails to close FSNamesystem with NPE.
914494_4;neutral;So yes it fails but not where you wanted it to.
2017630_2;neutral;we cannot find a problem in our implementation anymore perhaps there is a problem in he ACF implementation that force a other resultat. 
1532956_1;neutral;This looks like it might be a blocker for release.
1332525_1;neutral;I didn't see anything in subversion?
585405_1;neutral;Fixed in r1146573
527762_1;neutral;"Hi Christian Jacopo  Not sure if adding ""-Duser.language=en"" is the better way to go sounds like a camouflage to me."

222291_1;neutral;You are absolutely right.
222291_2;neutral;There must be some side effect in my project that circumvented this problem until 6.8.0.
222291_3;neutral;Sigh ....  Do you think that is something that can be fixed in Wicket or some kind of IE8 madness that i should look to solve on my side?

865459_2;neutral;the current command is modeled after the export shell command.
865459_3;neutral;export x=y sets the variable.
865459_5;neutral;we are missing an equivalent of export -n (to unset stuff).
865459_6;neutral;if this is not a good model - then we should switch it with something different altogether.

869647_1;neutral;Committed to branch.
775535_2;neutral;We have a guy looking into getting it in shape now but it will require you to update your current JIRA instance to 6.1 before doing another export for us.
775535_3;neutral;I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience but JIRA is really strict about the versions being equal when doing an import.
775535_4;neutral;So good news is we finally have a chance of testing the exports very soon bad news is it will require an update on your side to be able to transfer the spark JIRA data.
857619_1;neutral;Soundararajan Ning - Yes I am planning on working on it starting next week.
857619_2;neutral;I expect this to take at least upto mid to late in the week in order to get a patch available for this.

1020899_5;neutral;If we redid the meta tables in this format we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase a scan as opposed to the perverse expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.
1020899_6;neutral;This issue is about changing the way we name regions.
1020899_8;neutral;Converting to the new method we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.
1020899_9;neutral;Up to this the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation.
1020899_10;neutral;"HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region."
1020899_11;neutral;If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.
1406041_7;neutral;The two machines do not share the filesystem.
1406041_8;neutral;There is an embedded Tomcat running in the same JVM but according to the logs the database is not booted twice.
1406041_9;neutral;The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts.

1110348_1;neutral;Aaron: I completely agree the parser needs to be changed but I don't currently have the time available.
1110348_2;neutral;My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work.
1110348_3;neutral;If you're ok with that I think another jira should switch the parser.
1110348_4;neutral;Todd: I suppose it comes down to whether hadoop should favor posix or gnu extensions?
892816_1;positive;Thanks Todd glad to be on board!
476703_1;neutral;I tested this again on Ubuntu 10.04 This works with the new Tomcat instance and then when I tried the 2nd time it is not working.
476703_2;neutral;But when i delete the file which was created at <tomcat-home>/bin/search-index/write.lock  it works fine  but I'm not sure whether this creates other implications?
476703_3;neutral;Further I think the tags are not saved any ware because after redeploying I found the tags I added are missing.
476703_4;neutral;Is this due to the deletion of write.lock
639317_1;neutral;From the logs it is clear that the reducers could not fetch the output for map attempt attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036.
639317_2;neutral;Both the reducers (and possibly everybody else) is waiting on these.
639317_4;neutral;There is something mysterious going on here.
639317_5;neutral;If attempt id 1 was speculative the framework would not have killed it as the original attempt was a failure.
639317_7;neutral;In any case why did not the framework try and re execute this map somewhere else?

1116600_1;positive;Owen thanks for the slides.
1116600_2;neutral;I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183 more or less).
1116600_4;neutral;File formats are forever.
1116600_7;neutral;But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.
1116600_9;neutral;I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.
1116600_10;neutral;I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.
1116600_12;neutral;We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive language-independent serialization system and container file.
1116600_14;neutral;Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.
1116600_16;neutral;The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.
1116600_17;neutral;Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.
1116600_18;neutral;They cannot afford to do it frequently.

182715_3;neutral;Found when attempting to compile Xalan-J 2 with gcj.
1678692_1;neutral;Fixed in 1.2 branch as well.
367988_1;neutral;What is the right process to deprecate this behavior in 3.x?
367988_3;neutral;We could also try to detect the behavior and log a warning... but i'm not sure that is worth much.  
1390996_1;neutral;Changes appeared in 10.8.1 documentation so closing.
1684034_1;neutral;retrospectively setting fix version in preparation for SDO M3
750378_1;neutral;Solution looks as follows: when doing a cluster sync whether it is for reading or writing always acquire the version manager's read lock first.
626262_1;neutral;Patch adds javadoc for the newly added tests.
752306_1;neutral;Right and right after that is the section I was referring to.
477787_1;neutral;Hi Andreas  as we are a bank we can't provide you with the normal documents as they are internal documents.
477787_2;neutral;Therefore we will prepare a special document with a single checkbox will shows the error.
477787_3;neutral;It will come eiither today or tomorrow.
477787_4;positive;Thanks in advance Jens 
1393433_1;neutral;I've attached the output of dblook as db.sql and a simplified creation script as sample.sql that includes the relevant tables and columns with sample data.
1393433_2;neutral;I also verified that the bug still occurs in 10.6.1.0
1482538_1;neutral;Could you supply also a webapp sample?
1482538_2;neutral;It's easy look in the scratchpad/webapp/mount how it is done.
1482538_3;neutral;This could get many trying it and getting involved.
231637_2;neutral;Probably it is way deeper problem.
1211283_7;neutral;Thanks  Hari  
1513660_1;neutral;This has been fixed by check in for CHUKWA-274.
1377264_1;neutral;This patch adds the RelativeTest.java file which is a conversion of the jdbcapi/testRelative test to the same package as the latter.
1377264_3;neutral;Please review and comment if anything is lacking or incorrect.
675068_1;neutral;Bulk close for 3.1
793394_1;neutral;Mailing Lists to be set up before this cab be done.
748448_2;neutral;I really think there is an added value with this function for Jackrabbit users I personnally use it with every String-ordered query.
489104_1;neutral;No - unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge to digg into OpenJPA's code
963946_1;neutral;That is correct.
1355422_4;neutral;I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported although we removed support for it after 10.8) and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set and the test ran just fine on 1.4.
1355422_5;neutral;I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4.
1355422_6;neutral;The patch that broke the build on 10.9 was also backported to 10.8.
1355422_7;neutral;However on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4 so that's not a problem.
589914_2;neutral;Here are the results of testing the latest attachment    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12605661/MAPREDUCE-5538.6.patch   against trunk revision .
589914_4;neutral;The patch does not contain any @author tags.
237274_1;neutral;I still can't work out how to do this.
237274_2;neutral;Igor suggested moving the call to Component#onBeforeRenderChildren() inside Component#onBeforeRender() but if I do that I get an NPE in the ListView#renderItem() method even for basic code.
1068432_1;neutral;"Hmm the suggested patch is not good for DRLVM which handles ""-version"" normally."
1068432_2;neutral;What is the point to print only launcher version after all?
715499_1;neutral;The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release.
715499_2;neutral;There have been no new ones added for 2.3.
715499_3;neutral;So when 2.3 is released you shouldn't get the problems you've had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files.

355333_1;neutral;Patch with the fixes.
355333_2;neutral;Committing shortly.
959742_2;neutral;That one has not failed in a *very* long.
658544_1;neutral;Closed after release.
677770_2;neutral;Simon I'm going to get deletes working tests passing using maps in the RT branch then we can integrate.
677770_3;neutral;This'll probably be best.
677770_4;neutral;"Jason I suggest you create a separate issue something like ""Integrate BytesRefHash in Realtime Branch"" and I will take care of it."
677770_5;neutral;I think this issue had a clear target to factor out the hash table out of TermsHashPerField and we should close it.
677770_6;neutral;lets use a new one to track the integration.
1417766_1;positive;Thanks for looking into this Suresh.
1417766_2;neutral;Now I can see this from the traces too.
1417766_3;neutral;We are re-using the prepared statement after table t1 is dropped.
285591_1;neutral;Completed: At revision: 520469   
1472237_1;neutral;I believe this will be done only when the package name has to be changed due to backward incompatibilities.
526476_1;neutral;This is not new : we have the same type of behaviour when we switch languages...
1738716_2;neutral;There is no change to the default behavior.
428249_1;neutral;Fixed long ago.
428249_2;neutral;Deleting an entry now flushes the main page cache.
235124_1;neutral;the link you point to is not our official javadoc  our official javadoc is in the maven repo.
1152183_1;neutral;I would like to get some early comments on the changes I have made to the Namenode to support restarting within the same JVM.
853658_1;neutral;Oops you're right that makes sense.
853658_2;neutral;New patch that includes those changes.
1678342_2;neutral;In the future I could just get around the issue by using relative symlinks for those files (I think).
938748_4;neutral;The patch does not contain any @author tags.
938748_6;neutral;The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
938748_14;neutral;The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.
938748_18;neutral;The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.
938748_23;neutral;The mvn site goal succeeds with this patch.

694863_1;neutral;These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument.
694863_2;neutral;It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler.
694863_4;neutral;That method which inverts a single document was replaced with new code starting with 2.3 so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4.
514698_1;neutral;Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved search fields on root context and parameters map.
1604507_1;neutral;Yes but even for Java 5 a relative path to a directory with flattened dependencies would be shorter wouldn't it?
997092_1;neutral;Committed to 0.92 and trunk.
736254_4;neutral;The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.
736254_5;neutral;In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.
736254_6;neutral;if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.
736254_7;neutral;If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.
736254_8;neutral;* he knows that the classes are potentially unstable.
736254_9;neutral;In addition it makes the committer's life easier since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties.
1356706_2;neutral;What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase Kristian?
300300_1;neutral;Hi Julien please have a look on ./test/cpp/TestServer.cpp It's doing exactly what you what to do but TFramedTransport is explicitly specified there.
1009498_1;neutral;It looks like HLog main has support to invoke --split.
1009498_2;neutral;Does it looks like if I call that on the log that it will put split it and put the data into the right place?
1009498_3;neutral;We had a handful of regionservers go OOM yesterday while a MR job was doing heavy writes to a column family that doesn't usually get them.
1009498_4;neutral;In this case the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum.
982619_1;neutral;How about patch 2?
982619_2;neutral;"I added a ""."""
982619_4;neutral;So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes.
1629869_1;neutral;Hi Senaka  That is exactly what I'd like to do i.e. automatic download of CA cert and go ahead.

1571661_1;neutral;I couldn't reproduce this.
1571661_4;neutral;Ted can you reproduce this outside of cassidy.pl?
1643623_1;neutral;Thanks for the response.
1664747_1;positive;Thanks a lot for sharing that Josh!
1664747_2;neutral;I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go rather than through chaining which makes it a lot harder to see what is required.
1664747_5;neutral;Regarding Doug's points...  > But perhaps the preferred import should instead be 'import static SchemaBuilder.*'?
1664747_6;neutral;The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well.
1664747_9;neutral;> We can convert from Java object to JsonNode by parsing the output of GenericData.toString(Object).
1664747_10;neutral;Thanks.
1664747_11;neutral;I've updated the patch to do this but it still needs tests for this part.
995004_3;neutral;I'm thinking of multiple concurrent mutateRows operation trying to lock the same set of rows.
995004_4;neutral;Perhaps throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock.
995004_5;neutral;But we still might want to sort it to ensure (better) progress (no livelock).
1126952_1;neutral;Unless I'm missing something your patch doesn't actually change how the version is checked only how it's computed.
1126952_2;neutral;Did you intend to combine our patches or is your patch incomplete?
1427298_1;neutral;[bulk update] Close all resolved issues that haven't been updated for more than one year.
508238_1;neutral;- push out to 0.5
1719663_1;positive;Thanks a lot Subin.

1456970_2;neutral;"Although as far as I see it the bug here is that we allow the underscore after ""_design/"" not that we can't use filters from it."
367351_1;positive;Sweet :) You got there before me
639780_2;positive;Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
643148_1;positive;This looks simple and sweet to me.
355390_1;positive;Sweet kickstart for our new wiki!
527485_1;positive;Hello  Thanks a lot!  It works.  Lisa 
761562_1;positive;Yes please - pull request away my friend!
746372_2;neutral;See the below example  Employee1 Employee2 Employee3  Dept1.employess=Employee1 Dept1.employess=Employee3  Dept2.employess=Employee2  Intersection   Employee1 x Dept1.employess=Employee1 Employee3 x Dept1.employess=Employee3 Employee2 x Dept2.employess=Employee2  I don't like this sintax since it changes an obvious behaviour IMO.
746372_3;neutral;I would prefer to write it as  SELECT intersect(employeethis.employees).manager.lastname FROM org.apache.jdo.tck.pc.company.Department VARIABLES Employee employee   Now it's up to up to clearify

1114422_1;neutral;> we have to do it for each call.
1114422_2;neutral;I meant for each newly added/deleted ones.
1023779_1;negative;If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.
1023779_2;negative;It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though.
1411121_1;neutral;Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.
1411121_2;neutral;2) To get secure behavior for java routines the customer has to explicitly opt-in.
1411121_6;neutral;Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.
1411121_7;neutral;3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.
1411121_8;neutral;Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.
1411121_9;neutral;Then we defer to the system class loader.
1411121_10;neutral;3d) At runtime when we invoke the routine we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file. 
622001_1;neutral;MR's fix (similar to HDFS one).
1430031_1;neutral;Sample implementation of CREATE DATABASE and DROP DATABASE for MySQL 5.0.2+.
389675_4;neutral;They will save RAM to a certain extent for certain situations.
389675_5;neutral;But not very helpful at the sizes you are working with (and not settings I would use to save RAM anyway unless the amount I need to save was pretty small).
389675_9;neutral;None of the other caches have gone up much either.
389675_12;neutral;They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.
1171432_1;negative;Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.
1171432_2;neutral;Just really wondering/hoping you'd be interested in working on these ??

1008663_1;neutral;HADOOP-5679 changed this function to return int instead of void.
1729483_2;neutral;I can't come up with a pure-CSS in-place change for this.
1729483_3;neutral;Another alternative might be to make a little icon + onhover that displays the non-comma'ed value and change the default display to comma'ed?
1729483_4;neutral;The icon may be unnecessary maybe just onhover on the text itself?
1379857_1;neutral;Commited a fix for this into trunk using revision 610846.
1379857_2;neutral;I will work on merging this into 10.3 codeline and writing a test case.
1379857_3;neutral;The tests ran fine on my Windows XP machine with Sun jdk1.4 The commit comments are as follows  DERBY-3302 The user was running into null pointer exception at the time of database recovery because Derby was trying to get the Collator object through database context.
1379857_4;neutral;But the  Collator object is already available in the territory sensitive character classes and we do not have to go to database context to get it.
1379857_5;neutral;I changed the code to use that collator  object rather than look into database context.
561838_1;neutral;I would like to close this issue.
561838_2;neutral;Redirect handling has undergone significant changes since this issue was opened and we still need to take a hard look at redirects and possibly how scores are represented.
561838_3;neutral;However the newer scoring and indexing frameworks do work around this issue.
578573_1;neutral;Pushed to master.
626543_1;neutral;I have changed the title and description of this JIRA to fit our current idea.
1459150_1;positive;I love this.
1459150_3;neutral;A slow hash algorithm makes offline cracking harder.
1459150_4;neutral;It would require changes to the API to have crypto only run on the server but it might be simpler.
1688901_2;neutral;Fixed the crash in this bug let's open a new one for the SPDY connection issues.
582888_1;neutral;Could you attach a test case (Junit preferrably) that shows the unexpected behaviour? 
1613036_1;negative;I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.
1613036_2;neutral;This may only be related to the BlurIndexReader and may not be an issue in the BlurIndexNRT.
390196_1;neutral;marking Fixed in 1.3  (I believe Ryan left this open to track any potential issues ...  if nothing else this way we'll remember to resolve it before releasing)
459608_1;positive;Thanks for looking into this Allan.
459608_2;neutral;"I was thinking more of what happens on a Unix shell when you hit ""clear""."
459608_3;neutral;With your patch the cursor might still be at the end of the grunt window after 14 new lines.
1584099_1;positive;Thank you Babak!
1584099_2;positive;I will be the sponsor for your beer the next time we meet.
1589590_1;neutral;Claus I think I'm busy the next two weeks with [CAMEL-3468|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3468] [CAMEL-3472|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3472] [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471] [CAMEL-3470|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3470] and [CAMEL-3311|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3311].
1589590_2;neutral;Depending of the release date for Camel 2.6 and the priority of the other issues (may be I can reschedule [CAMEL-3471|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471] and/or other issues) I can do it in the remaining time.
1589590_3;positive;But I'm probably not an JMX expert... -)
1032584_1;neutral;Adds a new class of Exception.

1605364_1;negative;Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm!
1605364_5;positive;but both IDEA 7 and IDEA 8 seem to handle them just fine.
1605364_6;neutral;At some moments it could be upgraded to do IDEA 8 format but it's not important for now.
675071_1;neutral;Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?
675071_2;neutral;This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokens into smaller ones and recalculate offsets right?
675071_4;neutral;I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok.  Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?
675071_5;neutral;This seems to be what is causing the problem. 
836470_1;neutral;Uploading another patch for fixing the maven pattern to add the classifier.
1563411_3;neutral;I don't see the connection to .tmp files.
1563411_4;neutral;(Also: have you verified that the channel will actually infinite-loop returning 0?
1563411_7;neutral;IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').
1563411_8;neutral;The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.
1563411_9;neutral;What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes.
1563411_10;neutral;So this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so I think answered your second question so it wasn't very clear).
1563411_11;neutral;Note that without this patch there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu though very few probably in that case).
1563411_12;neutral;So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files.
1563411_13;neutral;But it does as a consequence of correctly raising an exception when should be.
792258_1;neutral;<joes4> lists will be available in 1 hour from now.

934135_5;negative;But it was not the only issue: we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities. 
1118631_1;neutral;I just committed this.
1118631_2;positive;Thanks Aaron!
708178_2;neutral;I knew they were missing and just forgot to do it before I committed it.
1357364_2;neutral;With the client you can connect to the same database many times.
1357364_3;neutral;I'll attach a zip with a small test project where you can reproduce the problem.
1357364_4;neutral;(all you need to add is your derby.jar)  I'm testing the DerbyTest from Eclipse.
1357364_5;neutral;I'm starting the 2nd version of DerbyTest from Eclipse as well.
1357364_6;neutral;When debugging it in Eclipse you can see the number of daemons grow very fast.
1357364_7;negative;While creating the DerbyTest I did notice that this problem is caused by the Database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background.
1357364_8;neutral;Still using a connection pool is pretty common.
1357364_9;positive;Please let me know if you need something else.
1357364_10;neutral;Regards  Leon   
894554_1;neutral;Hey Uma I've elected not to revert the patch as-committed since it does indeed fix the bug at hand.
894554_4;positive;If you would like to take up this work that'd be great.
894554_5;positive;Otherwise hopefully someone else will improve this code when they've got some time.
311661_1;negative;Sorry [~fiberlijun] - havent had a chance to look at it yet.
311661_2;neutral;Will try and do so within the next couple of days unless [~bikassaha] or [~sseth] beat me to it.
941315_1;neutral;Some folks on the mailing list had something like this happening to them.
698238_1;negative;> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this.
698238_2;neutral;My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.
698238_3;neutral;(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.)
698238_4;neutral;So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.
698238_6;neutral;An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.
698238_7;neutral;This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical.
698238_10;neutral;Is that what you meant?
939903_1;positive;[~lhofhansl] thank you so much.
939903_2;neutral;I will upload another patch (V5) in a couple minutes.
879843_1;neutral;Patch uploaded.
879843_2;neutral;Have passed all the local unit tests.
538019_1;negative;Sorry for all the issue mails I forgot to mention the second:  2) There is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed?
574945_3;neutral;If you want to work on it or assign it to someone else please do.
799938_1;neutral;If there's a problem with items being in the cache when they shouldn't be adding a check around the Add method isn't a solution to that problem.
799938_2;neutral;We should be Remove()ing items from the cache...not just overwriting them.
1010133_1;neutral;I applied an addendum for HBASE-3904 v6 to TRUNK.
1010133_3;neutral;However HBASE-4087 is required for the new unit test to pass.

1740169_2;neutral;"Watch out for ""Got InvalidDestinationException"" messages."
1497568_1;neutral;Kiran - I think this is a setup issue than anything else.
1497568_2;neutral;Hugo - if you couldnt reproduce it please close it
686001_2;neutral;How to handle the problem with LUCENE_29 setting and the posIncr of stopwords together with QueryParser that has a default setting of ignoring posIncr?
686001_3;neutral;How about adding required Version to QP ctor?
687610_1;positive;Thanks Mark for taking care of this issue!
687610_3;positive;this class funny coincidence :)  What are you thoughts about QueryParser being able to know about custom Query implementations?
687610_5;neutral;if I were to write a MyQuery class and implemen the toString method a certain way how would QueryParser know about MyQuery?
687610_6;neutral;Is it possible to extend QueryParser?
985359_1;negative;Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
985359_2;negative;I should have been very careful before doing this.
482429_1;neutral;"Hi  could you add the following line form.getDictionary().setItem(COSName.getPDFName(""NeedAppearances"")COSBoolean.TRUE)  right after PDAcroForm form = docCatalog.getAcroForm()  and try again?"
482429_2;neutral;BR Maruan
339639_1;neutral;Still about 2 hours worth of work left on this.
152998_1;negative;My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch... Resubmitting in a second. 
311643_2;neutral;Make scheduler heartbeat interval configurable (bikas) 
307952_1;negative;Damn.
307952_2;negative;Git is tricky that way.
307952_3;positive;:)  Will have a look.
1404948_2;neutral;Tests are meant to raise potential issues not to add variation of the issue.
1404948_3;neutral;I can see leaning toward to selects from the FLUSHER table with explicit checkpoints is a good balance for this case.
1404948_4;positive;However the goal of the test was very good.
1404948_5;neutral;I am not aware of whether we have test to fill the page cache with new data evicting all pages currently in the cache so the row count changes are written at a known point in time.
1404948_6;neutral;And it will be a good test to have in turn of code coverage point of view. 
1068983_2;neutral;Breakpoint handler frame is detected and processed specifically by unwinding algorithm.
1697610_1;neutral;Ran for almost an hour this time.
1697610_2;neutral;Dump looks similar to previous one.
473519_2;neutral;I addressed Shravan's request to add in the MRStreaming stuff into LocalLauncher and put in the jc.stop() calls after failed jobs in both Local and MapReduceLauncher.
934597_2;neutral;...and it seems like having 2 APIs KV and Cell for every method other than those that take Cell-types params...
934597_3;neutral;Which methods we talking about here?
934597_4;neutral;There a list?
149095_1;positive;Thanks Pat.
1415798_2;positive;I like this title.
1415798_3;neutral;It is specific to what it is describing.
544990_2;neutral;Couldn't the NodeState implementations in question (StoreNodeAsState AFAICS) just use their id to implement hashCode()?
781677_1;neutral;<joes4> This is a bug in FreeBSD's ldap support- sorry there's nothing we can do about it.

1547956_1;neutral;Aaron  Go ahead.
230395_1;neutral;Patch that adds the fix to WebResponse
728458_2;neutral;Some comments: 20.
728458_3;neutral;Log.truncateTo(): The following code seems to be used just for getting the first segment.
728458_8;neutral;22
728458_9;neutral;ReplicaManager: 22.1 recordLeaderLogUpdate(): Could we rename it to recordLeaderLogEndOffset()?
728458_11;neutral;22.3 readCheckpointedHighWatermark(): We should just read the HW from memory.
728458_12;neutral;The on-disk version is only useful on broker startup when we populate the in-memory HW using the on disk version.
728458_13;neutral;23
728458_14;neutral;"HighwaterMarkCheckpoint: Is it better to name the file "".highwaterMark"" so that it's hidden? "
1046439_1;neutral;I applied the patch at revision: 599008.
1046439_2;neutral;Still why do we hardcode these numbers e.g.
1046439_3;neutral;port/src/lil/em64t/pim/m2n_em64t_internal.h: #ifdef _WIN64 const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 120 #else const unsigned m2n_sizeof_m2n_frame = 104 #endif  vmcore/src/util/em64t/base/compile_em64t.cpp: // Stack size should be (% 8 == 0) but shouldn't be (% 16 == 0) const int ALIGNMENT = 0  Doesn't it worth to let compiler calculate such values? 
924133_1;neutral;It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.
924133_2;neutral;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp03216.html  {noformat} OutputStream out = fs.open(...) try {   out.write(...) } finally {   out.close() } {noformat}  When multiple files are involved the best thing is to nest the try blocks.
924133_3;neutral;Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS? 
870799_2;neutral;I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.
870799_3;neutral;Alternatively I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data but there are quota implications there.
870799_4;neutral;On startup I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated.
870799_6;neutral;I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked.
597488_1;neutral;Uploaded a patch that fixes the comments and includes the test
1017255_1;neutral;Thanks for the review.
1017255_2;neutral;We used to do 'stopping'.
1017255_3;neutral;Smile.
1017255_5;neutral;I think just needed for this at mo.
499702_1;positive;That's a good point we should make sure that it doesn't decrease performance for one of the database types even if it increases it for Oracle (in which case making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too).  
161056_1;negative;Sigh I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.
161056_2;negative;Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.
161056_4;neutral;Because this neither-here-nor-there code-reuse seems not much useful.
161056_7;negative;This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.
305460_1;neutral;fully agree Christian!
305460_2;negative;Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side....
305460_3;neutral;I refereed to the [^v1-enable-wall-werror.patch] which contains {{-Wall -Werror}} and I thought it sould be {{-Wall -Wextra}}  However just add {{-Wall}}  to that patch makes absolutely sense and could be committed.
1091112_2;negative;I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.
534670_1;negative;Sorry Chris  I missed it done !
671238_2;negative;We reported this crash to Oracle in plenty of time and the *worse* wrong-results bug has been open since May 13: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7044738 but Oracle decided not to fix that too. 
1029207_1;positive;(@ddlatham: thats kinda funny that you wrote the linked-to article -- it was a random google search)
731731_2;neutral;Maybe you can paste a SOAP query example request and explain the wrong behavior and what it is you are expecting?
1503502_2;neutral;Change its variable name to be more intuitive. 
1502781_1;neutral;you need to create system offering for system vms (ssvmcpvmrouter vm) and then you can upgrade to new system offerings it is only supported in vmware 
642162_1;neutral;[~smarthi] When I apply this patch the source code cannot be compiled.
642162_2;negative;One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved.
642162_3;neutral;Another error is that the class Functions.NEGATE is misspelled as Function.NEGATE.    
770457_1;neutral;If you have the opportunity to do it go ahead.
770457_2;negative;I'm very busy for the moment so I didn't know when I 'd be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated.
887647_1;negative;Oh I didn't consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately #store failed.
887647_2;neutral;Now again in the next trip of finalization it will throw NodeExistsException here it is really required to do the #store.
887647_3;negative;I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
887647_4;neutral;Patch looks good to me.
691111_1;neutral;I'm fine w/ not naming it Consumer - I agree it does not really consume it.
691111_2;neutral;But if we go with PayloadMergeProcessor we'll need PayloadMergeProcessorProvider and they become quite long names :).
691111_3;neutral;I was thinking PayloadProcessor and PayloadProcessorProvider (have cool acronyms to PP and PPP) but then people might get confused that it processes all payloads (maybe before they are even written the first time) while it is actually invoked only during segment merges.I was following the *Consumer pattern I saw all over the place w/ SegmentMerger and thought that if someone ever reads SM code it will swallow easily another *Consumer one ...
691111_4;neutral;So between PC PMP and PP - I prefer PP - the documentation should clarify what it does.
691111_5;neutral;But I'm open for suggestions.
859894_1;neutral;setting    set hive.script.auto.progress=true  seems to have no effect.
859894_2;negative;Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't) what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?
1490049_1;neutral;Abhinav can you also attach cloud_usage db dump.
1490049_2;neutral;Need it to test the fix.
303437_1;neutral;I changed the ubuntu version too.
1063055_1;neutral;By the way getCanonicalPath() performs actual file access may take long if drive is slow (e. g. Samba) may fail with exception if path is inaccessible at the moment (e. g. on network drive) etc.
1063055_2;neutral;On the other hand getAbsolutePath() is purely logical and doesn't need file system access. 
682430_1;negative;You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.
682430_2;neutral;The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created).
440583_1;negative;You would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms.
1725946_3;neutral;This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails.
1725946_4;neutral;Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?
1725946_5;neutral;There were most definitely 21 test case failures.
783620_1;neutral;<danielsh> Yes any23.zones.apache.org is the jail's hostname so use the IP it resolves to. 
930778_1;neutral;Yeah seems safe.
930778_2;negative;And the current behavior is irritating.
930778_3;neutral;Will commit a bit later unless somebody beats me to it.
187595_2;neutral;This symbol is not used for the Windows Netaccessor.
187595_3;neutral;Yeah?
187595_4;neutral;Please watch the source tree over the next several weeks before our next release.
190156_1;neutral;This is the bridge code minus the redundant bit.
151815_1;neutral;I would like that add that the problem is highly reproducible.
1667930_1;neutral;Looks great to me.
1667930_2;neutral;Thanks Doug.
1417788_1;negative;Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload.
1417788_2;neutral;These file describes my change:  derby1434-try2.diff (attached multiple times should have the same content) derby1434-try2.stat  
1342137_1;neutral;And it's somehow connected to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-137
1048263_2;neutral;If we put this jar to bootclasspath we'll have at least 5% performance boost on HWA application .
1048263_3;neutral;btw: maybe we should add this Jira's as subtasks to HARMONY-5277 ?

255981_1;negative;Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIB Not sure where this should go ...

207922_1;neutral;The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler the rest is just configuration loading on start up you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction and see what is going on.

787081_1;neutral;Hi  I have changed the rsync to rsync.eu.apache.org.
1634124_1;negative;i found the class - so there is no bug - sorry
1574835_1;neutral;> Stage 2 btw will involve documentation.
1574835_2;neutral;I'm not forgetting it :)   Did you forget it or did I miss it somewhere?
245930_1;negative;I was not aware of being required to call that method.
1019322_1;neutral;Thanks Mathias.
1019322_3;neutral;Bringing into 0.90.0.
1019322_4;neutral;Marking as critical.
461111_1;negative;Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs.
991251_1;neutral;@Jon Thanks for committing it.
1061211_1;neutral;The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.
1061211_2;neutral;It is not well documented in MSDN but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes.
1061211_3;neutral;Some functions don't require it but some do.
1061211_4;neutral;A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code so if a native method has an odd number of arguments additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes.
1017845_2;neutral;So I am likely going to work on this soon.
1017845_3;neutral;What is the exact problem?
1017845_4;neutral;If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :) 
1463502_1;neutral;You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code )  Also it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue.
242894_1;neutral;The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed.
242894_2;neutral;The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file.
232746_1;negative;Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this.
232746_2;neutral;Thanks for the patch.
232746_3;neutral;It works for me both in container and in testing with WicketTester. 
1093662_2;negative;I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.
1093662_3;neutral;"As I said on that thread I'm in a compilers class right now and I thought I might make a more ""enlightened"" attempt using lex/yacc soon and see where that gets me if no one else gets this done first."

1093662_5;neutral;"anyway if someone is brave enough to fix the ""attempt one"" script i wish them well ) "
934100_2;neutral;I added a rm -rf /tmp/h* to hadoopqa... and ran this again.... seems to be working:  https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7253/console  We'll see.
684519_2;neutral;by the way the only open impl of this algorithm i could find is at http://rrette.com/moman.html (ZSpell) in python.
684519_4;neutral;I might be on the trail of a java impl - get out the hounds!
684519_5;neutral;If you do take hold of it do not hesitate to share :) The original paper and C++ code likewise melt my brain and I needed the algo in some other place.
1028657_2;neutral;We can file issues with it as we find them.
1028657_3;negative;I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.
143877_1;neutral;Hi Deepa I looked at the transaction logs afaict this is not a bug rather the znode you mention is not deleted on session expiration because it was already explicitly deleted by another session.
143877_4;neutral;afaict things are working properly at least on the ZK side of things. 
750696_1;neutral;FWIW: this issue is a regression of JCR-890 i.e.
750696_2;neutral;the refactoring involved (r982520).
750696_3;neutral;there might be more hidden issues like this.
359088_2;negative;but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application  My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.

640140_1;negative;Excuse me for stolen assignement.
640140_2;neutral;I've saw this after completed the issue.
640140_5;neutral;I think it will be useful to standardize all the messages.
640140_6;negative;In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.
640140_8;negative;Must be: size >= 0!
1125138_1;neutral;Marking this an incompatible change so that it gets attention.
1125138_2;neutral;Also setting webinterface.private.actions has other effects like enabling the 'kill job' and 'kill task' links on the Job web UI.
916437_4;neutral;In that case the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon.

534574_1;neutral;David  I've done a little digging and have a question around:  OrderReadHelper.getOrderItemQuantityBd()  Firstly going back a while now this log:     http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs/trunk/components/order/src/org/ofbiz/order/order/OrderReadHelper.java?rev=4367&r1=4281&r2=4367 shows a change to the strings that seems to make the first if statement redundant?!
534574_2;neutral;I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?
534574_4;negative;Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.

564075_1;negative;(back from holidays so a bit delayed but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example.
564075_2;negative;HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with.
1326729_2;neutral;It would be great if you could work on it.
1326729_3;neutral;Thus assigning the issue to you.
528962_1;negative;Hi Marco  I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar sorry for inconvenience.
528962_2;neutral;"I have uploaded the modified patch ""PartyCommunication.patch"" and it is ready for testing. "
1672977_1;neutral;This is the reverse side of ARIES 399 which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe.
1672977_3;neutral;Or at least the locks need to be much more fine-grained than locking the whole container.
1672977_4;neutral;I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :)
1552294_1;neutral;i modified the test class from HADOOP-6148 (bigger is better) the result is:   ||bytes||PureJava MB/sec||Native MB/sec||Random PureJava MB/sec||Native MB/sec|| | 1
1500398_1;neutral;I fixed the build failures on 4.1 this morning.
1500398_3;neutral;I'm doing an automated test as well.
1500398_4;neutral;Will close this ticket if there are no issues.
870881_1;neutral;FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #344 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/344/]) HDFS-5041.
870881_2;neutral;Add the time of last heartbeat to dead server Web UI.
1173673_2;negative;Sorry for the mistake.
460954_1;negative;Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
1537801_1;negative;First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
1537801_2;neutral;Is that part of the test in question?
547122_2;neutral;lifecycle management up to a separate container  Agreed and my patch also contains a TODO for that.
547122_3;neutral;Similar to all other plugins the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g.
547122_4;neutral;in an OSGi container as a separate bundle.
547122_5;neutral;Instead of hardcoding the hooks we could introduce a LifeCycleHookProvider similar to ValidatorProvider we already have.
547122_7;neutral;Subject.doAs tricks  Good point.
547122_9;neutral;I'll try the approach you suggested.
1499834_1;neutral;api_key and secret_key are not required.
1499834_2;neutral;data sync is external to cloudstack
1410139_1;neutral;Thank you Ole!
1410139_2;neutral;Committed v2 patch to trunk with revision 508383.
1100055_1;neutral;Committed to HDFS-3042 branch.
574180_2;neutral;I said above that the earlier patches were lost but nope there they are.
574180_3;negative;Sorry I took Martin's comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around.
646202_1;neutral; What platform?
646202_2;neutral;Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?
1194263_1;neutral;We need to make this configurable before we can apply this patch to the trunk (unless i have misunderstood the effect).
1194263_3;neutral;Thanks Cyriaque.
182292_1;negative;I don't know what just happened.
182292_2;negative;The patch went to the wrong bug.
1163131_1;neutral;> Another thing: is the try ... catch good or bad?
1163131_2;negative;Our caller may not notice what happend right now.
1163131_4;neutral;I guess will be better not catch since until now was not being catched and will be good to propagate upwards.
1163131_5;negative;Sorry for my poor review didn't notice try/catch :(
1037240_1;neutral;v2 removes some dross included by misstack.
718497_1;neutral;You could easily test if it is due to felix by switching to equinox if the effects are still there blame it on pax web or dosgi.
1185454_1;neutral;This jira is unassigned but contains a patch that needs to be reviewed for inclusion in 1.1.1.
1129306_1;neutral;Would a new configuration boolean 'fs.manual.shutdown' be adequate for your needs?
1129306_2;neutral;You could programatically set this before getting your filesystems and when set true the shutdown hook would not be added.
869031_1;neutral;Vinay thanks for working on this.
869031_2;neutral;Some comments:  The new method added to Namesystem is better to # pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction # call it as isInSnapshot and # do not throw IOException.
869031_4;neutral;{code} //Namesystem.java public boolean isInSnapshot(BlockInfoUnderConstruction block) {code} In the implementation in FSNamesystem it should try-catch the UnresolvedLinkException and log it as an error since the full path obtained from a file should not have unresolved link.
869031_5;neutral;Second question: Why adding DFSTestUtil.abortStream(..)?
869031_6;negative;It does not look very useful.
639696_1;neutral;I appended the information to the end of the file.
795428_2;neutral;You have the ability to add users to the mina group in svn not to the group on people.a.o.
795428_3;neutral;To grant new users commit access check out https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization and add the appropriate usernames to the mina= line in the [groups] section of the asf-authorization file.
520683_2;negative;I did it wrong this time.
238508_1;negative;"No idea about the issue resolution/if it's still active but I'm afraid that by no stretch of the imagination can it be termed a ""Critical"" issue."
589202_1;neutral;shifted as agreed during the IRC release preparation meeting
285534_1;neutral;thx to Cristi Toth  for his patch
309130_2;neutral;Pull out the RopeTransport stuff fix the bug and add in the graceful degradation and I'm happy to see it pushed :)
1470935_2;negative;Sorry I had attached an older version... let's try this one.
1470935_3;neutral;I guess it's OK to put it in trunk.
1470935_4;neutral;I did not write it in a way that fits in with the rest of the implementations though.
1470935_5;neutral;No unit tests either yet.
1470935_6;negative;However I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work.
1680512_1;negative;This is only a problem with exceptions from java.
1680512_2;neutral;* regular business exceptions work.
908493_2;neutral;Resubmitting and making it a blocker for 0.22
1560034_1;negative;Sorry I kind of forget about this one.
1560034_2;neutral;I'm good with the last version of the patch of just adding a dclocal read repair chance.
1014768_2;neutral;So I went ahead and made the change.
1014768_3;neutral;It's uploaded here and on review board.
160613_1;neutral;Removed version-infomation znode.
1518664_1;neutral;More like can't fix.

1584891_2;neutral;I will update the docs (probably this weekend when I find some time)
1117591_1;neutral;Updated patch with new file.

620209_2;neutral;The patch looks good to me.
620209_4;neutral;{noformat} _harMetaCache {noformat}  Also this is meant for trunk only?   
303553_2;neutral;It would be *highly* preferable instead to *not* include the BoostMonitor.cpp change as both are inter-dependent.
303553_3;neutral;Alternatively I don't know what is the compiler error on Debian but it may very well be missing the include inside BoostMutex.cpp:  {code} #include <boost/thread/mutex.hpp> {code}  Thanks!

168203_2;neutral;the underlying protobuf handles the null properly.

983442_2;neutral;Could we keep this DataOutputBuffer for reuse?
189480_2;neutral;If I'll come across Xerces again I'll try it.
1556677_1;neutral;Thanks Vijay.
1665696_1;neutral;"I can see why the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text ""foo""."
1665696_2;negative;That is a bit too lax I think.
1665696_3;neutral;"The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely it does come through just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(""Unknown datum type: ""+datum) error."
1665696_4;neutral;"So instead of the expected ""java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"" text being sent you get ""org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo""."
1665696_5;negative;The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
1349696_1;negative;I am new to Mina and the whole environment.
1349696_2;neutral;Anyway I am creating a project that began with 2.0.0-M3 and is now using 2.0.0-M4.
1349696_4;negative;Any word on whether it will be fixed?
1570991_1;neutral;"that it's a huge patch is exactly why I don't want to take a ""let's just commit it and clean it up later"" approach."
424120_3;neutral;Make sure to use the hsync api for persistency guarantees.

857556_1;neutral;Hi Carl I've made the changes JAVA_HOME and README.txt suggested by you.
857556_2;neutral;I tested the JAVA_HOME change in Linux and it doesn't seem to work (unset JAVA_HOME and launch Eclipse for debugging).

1108519_1;neutral;There are a few considerations to be careful about: 1) The hostname in service could be a vip name.
1108519_4;neutral;One way to address it is to get the ip address from the hostname service and use that for matching but that needs a dns lookup.
1108519_5;neutral;2) Dns lookup in token selector would be invoked for every connection using token authentication.
1279563_1;negative;Incomplete example.
1279563_2;negative;Unable to reproduce issue.
1166260_1;positive;Sounds good Claudio.
1166260_2;neutral;I used to have the subset of in-memory partitions maintained as a sliding window (i.e.
1166260_4;neutral;We can go back to something like that if we want to manage that subset more intelligently (2).
1202409_1;neutral;As I explained the XSL files have nothing to do with FOP so its impossible  for FOP to tell you which file/line number in XSL stylesheet(s) the problem  lies at.
1202409_2;neutral;FOP can only tell you which line in the single FO file the error  occurred at.
1218390_1;negative;Oh ok.
1218390_2;neutral;I'll focus my efforts on the compile targets then.
1218390_3;neutral;We'll have plenty of time to go through the bundles later.
1163124_1;neutral;gora-cassandra is patched to work with this prove of concept (It's just a one-liner in CassandraStore).
1163124_2;neutral;I meant if someone eventually uses CassandraClient directly this will break.

483577_3;neutral;Just picking a type from one of the types was a simple enough solution.
356317_1;negative;Sorry for the spam - but which test method - can't find any related to the SnapPuller on trunk.

1072532_1;negative;Sorry - the federated build is still working out kinks...

243701_1;neutral;This is is my todo list still but hasn't risen to the top.
726893_1;neutral;Yeah we can do it in 0.8.1 which should happen fairly quickly after 0.8 but we are really trying to lock down 0.8 to critical fixes and this is more of a new feature (though obviously desirable).
726893_2;negative;Sorry for the hassle.
204591_1;negative;WOW....you are right...I'm deeply sorry to bother you guys (and I'm also a bit embarrassed).
1477405_1;neutral;Looks like there's a code freeze for 2.1.8 happening right about now but this still hasn't been committed.

691246_1;neutral;Eventually I decided to include just one patch file (instead of code and test) since it was simpler after all.
691246_2;neutral;Please be sure to review the following: # Collector class and documentation.
440994_1;neutral;One underlying cause of this issue is QPID-4731 
1075917_1;negative;Sorry that I think I missed some discussion in the mailing list.

724407_1;neutral;Supplemental patch committed.
724407_2;neutral;I'm leaving this issue open for further discussion.
368447_1;neutral;Committed to trunk.
368447_3;neutral;3.x does not have a mechanism to pass state across core reloads and that's a change I'd rather leave to 4.x.
368447_4;neutral;Might simply be best to track all directories and close them on shutdown.
1527349_1;neutral;Shazron  I am using alert to visually notify myself.
1527349_2;neutral;Inferring that it might make a difference based on your comment I tried using 'console.log()' and the unexpected behavior was no longer present.
1418030_2;neutral;Reviews appreciated.
